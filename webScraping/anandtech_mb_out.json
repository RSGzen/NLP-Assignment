This morning, AMD has released a second statement regarding the issue, including what it is doing to rectify the problem and put Ryzen 7000 processor owners at ease.", "The official statement from AMD is as follows:", "To counteract the problem, AMD has apparently identified an issue with specific chip voltages going too high when users enable AMD's EXPO memory profiles. A new cap on SoC voltages looks to be the primary change in the AGESA firmware rollout.", "However, AMD's broad statement mentions that the update will address ", " power rails, which implies to some degree that the issue may be more than just the SoC power rail – or at least, that AMD isn't taking any chances.

So going past this is putting additional stress on the memory controller in terms of clockspeeds; but the greater concern is how the various voltages on the chip are being adjusted to keep up with the demands of higher memory speeds.", "One interesting point about AMD's statement is that it doesn't allude to whether or not the issue is just on its Ryzen 7000X3D processors, or whether it affects all of its Ryzen 7000 processors entirely. Regardless of the Zen 4 chip that users may have, AMD is ambiguous in its language, and it seems to be that AMD is recommended that ", " users with a Ryzen 7000 series processor should update to the latest firmware.", "In practice, enabling EXPO memory profiles on compatible DRAM does seem to push SoC voltages beyond AMD's safe spot on the Ryzen 7000 processors, which AMD is treating as part of the cause of the burnout issue. AMD does, however, state that the changes it has made to their AGESA firmware, once flashed, shouldn't affect the user's ability to apply EXPO memory profiles on compatible kits of DDR5 memory. Which does raise the question of why motherboards were increasing SoC voltages in the first place, as presumably this shouldn't be needed if AMD's new caps won't limit EXPO memory overclocking.", "In any case, AMD is actively working with its motherboard partners to release a new AGESA firmware with the new voltage limits, which they say has already been distributed. AMD claims that all AM5 motherboard vendors and models should have a new BIOS version available to them within the next few days, and is recommending all users to update their BIOS at their earliest convenience."]},

Unfortunately, it's been even more chaotic for some users with AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D processors. There have been several reports of Ryzen 7000 processors burning up in motherboards, and in some cases, burning out the chip socket itself and taking the motherboard with it.", "Over the past few weeks, we've covered the issue as it's unfolded, with AMD releasing two official statements and motherboard vendors scrambling to ensure their users have been updating firmware in what feels like a grab-it-quick fire sale, pun very much intended. Not everything has been going according to plan, with AMD having released two new AGESA firmware updates through its motherboard partners to try and address the issues within a week.", "The first firmware update made available to vendors, AGESA 1.0.0.6, addressed reports of SoC voltages being too high. This AGESA version put restrictions in place to limit that voltage to 1.30 V, and was quickly distributed to all of AMD's partners. More recently, motherboard vendors have pushed out even newer BIOSes which include AMD's AGESA 1.0.0.7 (BETA) update. With even more safety-related changes made under the hood, this is the firmware update AMD and their motherboard partners are pushing consumers to install to alleviate the issues – and prevent new ones from occurring.", "In this article, we'll be taking a look at the effects of all three sets of firmware (AGESA 1.0.0.5c - 7) running on our ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard. The goal is to uncover what, if any, changes there are to variables using the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, including SoC voltages and current drawn under intensive memory based workloads.", "Here is our recent coverage of the Ryzen 7000X3D/7000 'burnout' issues, including two statements from AMD, an official response from ASUS and MSI:", "The first firmware update made available to vendors, AGESA 1.0.0.6, addressed reports of SoC voltages being too high, with new restrictions put in place to limit things to 1.30 V. In the case of the board we've been using to try and dig deeper into issues, the ASRock X670E Taichi, this was made available to the public on 4/27/23 through its 1.21 firmware update. More recently, on 5/4/23, ASRock made its latest 1.24.AS02 firmware, which includes AMD's AGESA 1.0.0.7 (BETA) update.", "The AGESA 1.0.0.7 (BETA) update is the firmware that AMD has been planning to roll out most recently to alleviate the issues of burnout, not just for Ryzen 7000X3D chips with 3D V-Cache, but also across the broader Ryzen 7000 and AM5 ecosystem. In between the initial AGESA 1.0.0.5c firmware that brought AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D support to AM5 motherboards, in the space of a mere 32 days, AMD has released a total of three major AGESA versions, which ASRock has dutifully published for the X670E Taichi. We'll be using this as our baseline for our analysis and look into what's going on.", "On top of this, AMD is also planning to release an even more robustly updated AGESA firmware, which could be in the coming weeks. Referred to internally as AGESA 1.0.0.9, we did reach out to AMD for comment on this, but our rep couldn't comment on unannounced or internal only software stacks. It should also be noted that the current firmware at the time of writing available to users is a BETA version, implying that a newer AGESA is undoubtedly on its way. Still, the timescale of the release is anyone's guess currently.", "So looking at the variations in AMD's AGESA updates over the last month, there hasn't been any official indication of changes other than the bare minimum, at least not from ASRock's descriptions. The following is what ASRock is saying about the descriptions of the AGESA updates:", "The description of the changes, at least from the point of ascertaining what each AGESA is offering, is borderline pitiful. In none of the descriptions does it state what changes AMD has made to each AGESA firmware to address the current issues, which in all honesty, is a pretty big thing to omit. There are no indications whatsoever on ASRock's X670E Taichi BIOS page as to what each firmware changes, and with no public notes available to users, it's a case of update to this firmware, it's recommended.", "So what do we know about the changes? Well, we know the critical change going from AGESA 1.0.0.5c to the 0.6 and 0.7 versions is a lockdown on SoC voltage to 1.30 V. Previously, on the ASRock X670E Taichi with 1.0.0.5c; we were able to set the SoC voltage to 2.5 V, which would almost certainly result in frying our X3D chips like an egg.", "", "The other changes coming with AGESA 1.0.0.6, according to ", ", AMD has also added two new PROCHOT entries that point directly to combating overheating. PROCHOT essentially means Processor Hot, and it is a controlled mechanism that is designed to protect the processor from overheating. There are two implementations here. The first is the PROCHOT Control mechanism which is precisely what it says on the tin. When the CPU hits a defined value, the component sends a PROCHOT Control signal, and the CPU draws less power to try and mitigate temperatures and reduce the risk of damage. ", "The second mechanism is PROCHOT Deassertion Ramp Time, which dictates how long a processor can ramp up the power after the initial PROCHOT Control signal has been disabled. Essentially, PROCHOT Deassertion Ramp is the time it takes for the processor to get back up to normal parameters, and different variables, including cooling, the aggressiveness of said cooling, and general heat dissipation quality, can dictate this time. If the processor is inadequately cooled, this can result in a longer deassertion ramp time, whereas more aggressive heat dissipation methods should theoretically allow for a quicker ramp-up time.", "Before the rollout of new firmware, Steve Burke, the Editor-in-Chief of Gamers Nexus, and his team investigated", ", including looking at the original fried hardware from Speedrookie. This includes a faulty and bulged out Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor and his burnt ASUS ROG STRIX X670E E Gaming motherboard. Instead of RMA'ing the hardware, Steve Burke reached out to the user and offered to buy the hardware from him, minimizing the RMA lead time and allowing Speedrookie to purchase new hardware.", "The ", " is a very good watch, and we certainly recommend that users watch this, especially for those more interested in the inner workings (or issues) of the Ryzen 7000X3D and 7000 series processors. To summarize Steve's findings, we took away the following points:", "While Steve and his team at Gamers Nexus have gone deep into uncovering the root causes of the problem, one thing remains abundantly clear: the issue is not just one that relates to SoC voltage. There has certainly been some confusion between AMD themselves and its motherboard partners in implementing the appropriate failsafe to prevent the CPU (and motherboard socket, for that matter) from burning into oblivion.", "The other problem relates to ASUS here, with a more aggressive implementation of its SoC voltages, which Gamers Nexus confirmed in their testing as running too high. Before the AGESA firmware (1.0.0.6) update through BIOS version 1202, ASUS was overshooting SoC voltage by 0.05 V over AMD's newly imposed SoC voltage limit of 1.3 V.", "", "Soldering leads and connecting the motherboard to a digital multimeter, a 1.35 V SoC setting within the ASUS firmware (and with EXPO enabled) resulted in an observed 1.398 V from an SoC pad. This was typically even higher when probed at the choke, at an eye-watering 1.42 V. This fundamentally poses a problem that ASUS's firmware and the SoC rails themselves aren't cohabiting well with each other. An additional 0.05 V on top of the recommended 1.30 V is a lot, to say the least, but adding an extra 0.05 V on top of ", " can undoubtedly lead to dielectric degradation and possibly lead to dead CPUs and burnt motherboard sockets.", "Doing some preliminary testing on the effect of SoC voltage on stability on the latest AGESA 1.0.0.7 (BETA) firmware, our G.Skill DDR5-6000 kit of DDR5 memory (2 x 16 GB) on the ASRock X670E Taichi would automatically preset 1.30 V on the SoC when applying the EXPO memory profile. To elaborate, unfortunately, we tried 1.15 V, which was a no-go, and even 1.20 V was a no-go. We eventually settled on 1.25 V on the SoC for this kit and our Ryzen 9 7950X3D, and we found stability in memory-intensive benchmarks was solid.", "Perhaps one of the biggest things to come outside of Gamers Nexus's testing was that AMD is now offering RMA support for users who have used EXPO memory profiles, something which normally voids the warranty on AMD's processors. Whether or not other regions intend to honor these RMA requests hasn't been confirmed, but it's unlikely to be an issue.", "Still, it's a good gesture for users with damaged CPUs from an issue that is entirely not their fault. Motherboard vendors, on the other hand, operate within their policies and parameters, and it may be trickier getting an RMA on a damaged motherboard simply because AMD doesn't control motherboard vendors' RMA policies. We would hope in good faith that motherboard vendors will honor the warranty in instances of these burnout issues, but we cannot confirm if they will at this time.", "To summarize the reason for testing AMD's AGESA firmware, we aren't trying to replicate burning our Ryzen 7000X3D samples – enough processors have already been sacrificed for science. For that matter, we certainly didn't see or smell any smoke coming from our ASRock X670E Taichi during testing, so we'll take that as a good sign.", "Our purpose for testing is to highlight any differences or variations in parameters and power-related elements coming from AMD's latest AGESA packages. This includes looking at rails like SoC voltage and Package Power Tracking (PPT) output from the AM5 CPU socket. As AMD has dialed down what users and motherboard vendors can apply in regards to SoC voltage to 1.30 V, it's worth noting that all of ASRock's firmware we've tested on the X670E Taichi in this piece automatically sets SoC voltage to 1.30 V.  While we don't have the necessary tools and equipment to solder leads to the motherboard to observe 'physical' voltages, we are relying on HWInfo's reporting prowess, as well as looking at multiple temperatures.", "We also did some in-house stability testing against the new SoC voltage limits, running a fresh batch of tests on our Ryzen 9 7950X3D paired with a G.Skill DDR5-6000 (2 x 16 GB) memory kit with its AMD EXPO memory profile enabled. We found that things weren't stable until we applied 1.25 V on the SoC voltage within the firmware. Hitting up to 1.25V on the SoC, our kit was rock solid, even in memory-intensive workloads and benchmarks.", "That has been our focus, trying to push the memory as hard as we can to ensure complete stability. A lot of the fanfare surrounding the issue, on the whole, has been unfairly put on AMD's EXPO profiles as being one of the causes; it is not. We know that CPU-intensive workloads will generate more heat, but that isn't what we've been looking at investigating. We're looking for variations in current and power between the different firmware versions to see if AMD (and ASRock) has made optimizations within its framework to reduce these factors, with current, or more specifically over current and the integrated failsafes being bypassed, which is one of the key concerns in the burnouts.", "Our test bench for our AGESA (AM5) update testing is as follows:", "For our choice of workloads, we're relying on the Memory Test Suite from Openbenchmarking.org via Phoronix to implement our memory-intensive workloads. Although some of these workloads aren't optimized and don't run on Windows, we used the ", ", which uses multiple data types across read, write, modify, and read/write/modify combined.

Interestingly, ASRock's adopted a simpler design with less color on the heatsinks and a broader focus on blacks, silvers, and greys for an overall cleaner look. One critical fundamental change is removing a lot of the 'armor' that covers the bottom half of the board, which on the original Z790 Taichi also looks good. Users that don't want any RGB LED lighting can turn them off in the firmware or through the software included by each vendor, which is the same for most motherboards, at least ones we've tested over the years.", "As the ASRock Z790 Taichi and the newer and lighter Z790 Taichi Lite share the exact core specifications, users can be confident that both boards should perform similarly. Some of the main specifications include an advertised 24+1+2 power delivery, with 105 A smart power stages, and support for up to DDR5-7200 memory. The ASRock Z790 Taichi Lite also has an uprated audio configuration with a Realtek ALC4082 HD audio codec doing the grunt work of the audio processing, with an ESS Sabre 9218 DAC and WIMA audio caps adding an additional layer of quality to the onboard audio capabilities.

The ASRock Z790 Taichi Carrara edition builds upon the successful Taichi series. The Carrara portion of the naming represents the elegant white marble-inspired finish across the board's rear I/O panel, PCIe armor, and heatsinks, effectively replacing all the typical cogwheels and whatnot. ", "The Z790 Taichi Carrara, as it stands, is ASRock's current Z790 flagship, meaning it's their most premium model and comes with many features. Of all the ASRock LGA 1700 motherboards that support the 13th Gen and 12th Gen Core series chips, the ASRock Z690 Aqua is technically the brand's main flagship and halo model. That's certainly apparent in the Taichi series, which bridges the gap between the more mid-range models, such as the Z790 LiveMixer (review coming soon), with the Z690 Aqua. As Z790 is more of a refresh than a new platform, it's understandable why ASRock hasn't launched another Aqua model.", "Taking a closer look at the ASRock Z790 Taichi Carrara, the most prominent feature of the aesthetics is the white Carrara marbled finish across the rear IO and audio PCB covers, as well as the chipset and the M.2 heatsinks. It is a striking yet elegant look, and it's very different from what's currently on the market. As such, ASRock also includes a 120 cm Carrara finished fan for users to install as a rear exhaust fan, and it also helps with matching components up to complete the look, which may be challenging to do.

Looking at an overall view of the board from a birds-eye view, the Z790 Aorus Xtreme is predominately covered by waves of Aorus-inspired armor, which also includes a large metal chipset and PCIe armor cover across the center of the PCIe slot area, as well as a large rear panel cover. Interestingly, the rear panel cover features a 2.8-inch digital LCD monitor, which displays real-time system information such as CPU temperature, CPU clock speed, memory clock speed, and VRM temperatures. Typically a feature on high-end premium models such as this, the LCD display is a nice touch, but it does require a chassis with a clear windowed side panel to take advantage of this.", "Touching more on GIGABYTE's implementation of cable management, the Z790 Aorus Xtreme, all around the edging of the board, features right-angled headers, connectors, and power inputs. Designed to allow users to plug a cable in at a right angle, this makes it easier as the cables don't directly stick out and can seamlessly be directed through the grommets within a chassis for a more uniform and less cluttered look. GIGABYTE also includes PCIe and M.2 EZ-latches, meaning PCIe and M.2 drives are easily installed and re-installed into the chassis at the tap of a switch or the flick of a thumb.", "Removing the large metal mid-plate across the middle of the PCIe slot area and the CPU drive PCIe 5.0 x4 M.2 slot reveals the bulk of the board's M.2 slot array. The plate itself acts as a large PCIe M.2 heatsink for the three central PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 slots, as well as a cover for the chipset heatsink. In total, the GIGABYTE Z790 Aorus Xtreme has five M.2 slots, with one PCIe 5.0 x4 fed from the CPU as mentioned with a large heatsink covering it, three PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 slots sandwiched in between the top two full-length PCIe slots, and one PCIe 4.0 x4/SATA M.2 located below the chipset heatsink. For SATA, GIGABYTE includes four right-angled SATA ports which are capable of supporting RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10 arrays.", "Regarding PCIe slot support, interestingly, GIGABYTE opts for just one full-length PCIe 5.0 x16 slot, with two full-length PCIe 3.0 slots operating at x4 and x1. Having fewer PCIe 5.0 lanes designated to full-length slots provides benefits and disadvantages, but given many aftermarket PCIe add-on cards can't use the immense bandwidth of PCIe 5.0 at present other than NVMe SSDs, the bandwidth, and the subsequent lanes can be directed to other areas such as controllers. Other users may argue that having two full-length PCIe 5.0 slots can deliver extra lanes to faster PCIe M.2 storage devices through a multi-M.2 slot adapter, but with five M.2 slots integrated onto the board, there's still plenty of scope for storage here.", "Focusing on the power delivery on the Z790 Aorus Xtreme, GIGABYTE has gone for a large 20+1-phase design, with premium componentry expected from a board of this caliber. For the CPU, GIGABYTE has included 20 x Renesas RAA22010540 105 A smart power stages, which operate in a teamed configuration and are driven by a Renesas RAA229131 PWM controller. There's also a single RAA22010540 150 A power stage for the SoC. Interestingly, GIGABYTE has employed a teamed setup for the VRM and not a full 20-phase direct configuration, but the output equates to a maximum of 2100 A for the CPU to play with, which is overkill.", "Keeping the power delivery cool is a very large pair of heatsinks interconnected by a single 8 mm thick heat pipe with a nanocarbon-coated fin array. GIGABYTE claims that using a 22-micrometer thick nanocarbon coating on the thins can reduce VRM temperatures by up to 10%. Looking at the indentations within the 12 W/mk thermal pads used by GIGABYTE, the heatsink makes good contact with the majority of the power stages and chokes, which is a good indicator that contact and thermal dissipation should be, in theory, optimal.", "On the premium Z790 motherboards such as this, we typically see support for much faster memory, and the Z790 Aorus Xtreme is no exception. GIGABYTE supports up to DDR5-8000 (OC) memory in a dual channel (1DPC) configuration, with up to 192 GB supported across four slots.

Unlike the current generation of consumer desktop chipsets such as Z690, H670, B660, and H610, the W680 adds the capability to use ECC DRAM, including both DDR5 and DDR4 variants. At present, there haven't been many W680 motherboard announcements, although a couple of vendors, including ASRock Industrial and Supermicro have a few options listed. So we're giving you the lowdown on W680, what it has to offer, and what technologies it brings for users looking to build a workstation-class desktop with Intel's latest Alder Lake architecture.", "Typically when Intel launches a new series of processors for the desktop market, it releases multiple chipsets with varying levels of features. For its 12th Gen Core family, Intel initially launched its CPUs and premium Z690 chipset, and followed that up with its more affordable H660, B660, and H610 chipsets. In most generations the product stack is rounded out a bit later with a W-series workstation-focused chipset, and finally a variety of Xeon-E series.", "Enter the ", ", which is Intel's designated workstation chipset for its 12th Gen Core platform. The Intel W680 chipset is interesting for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that that it formally opens up ECC memory support for Intel's Alder Lake-S desktop processors.", "", "Some of the main features of the W680 chipset include a PCIe 4.0 x8 DMI link, which connects the processor to the chipset for improved bandwidth over Intel's previous W-series chipsets. Other features include support for up to eight SATA ports and integrated Wi-Fi 6E PHY/2.5 GbE MACs for vendors to hook in the latest networking controllers. Intel includes support for 16x PCIe 5.0 lanes from the CPU, with the usual 16/0 or 8/8 bifurcation options.", "Other features with W680 include native support for USB 3.2 Gen2x2 (20 Gbps) Type-C connectivity. However, most of the cost and implementation of networking and connectivity still rely on vendors using solutions through proprietary CNVi connections. This is much the same story on regular Z690, H670, B660, and H610 options, the cost for the target market is a massive factor here on what vendors decide to include or omit.

{"title": "Multi-chip Intel Core i9-11900K Overclocking Review: Four Boards, Cryo Cooling", "paragraph": ["Before launching in March, there was a lot of discussion about Rocket Lake's potential performance. On the one hand, it looked just like another 14nm design refresh such as Skylake. While this is somewhat true, the reality is that it provides an advancement incrementally in terms of Intel's research and design model; Rocket Lake is actually retrofitted its 10nm design onto 14nm, for multiple reasons, including CPU core frequency (it's higher on 14nm), cost (14nm is cheaper to manufacture), and peak thermal window. The last point has been another talking point as Rocket Lake runs warm. One of the reasons for this, outside of refinements and improvements to turbo frequencies and internal automatic overclocking technologies, is Intel's move to PCIe 4.0 which comes directly from the CPU. As we found out ", " (and verified on the ", "), if you blast this chip with a strong AVX-512 workload, you can draw near 300 watts, however day-to-day running at half that is easily par for the course. ", "While there are many options on Intel's 11th generation for desktop, including various Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9 processors, the current flagship in the line-up is the Core i9-11900K. The Intel Core i9-11900K features 8 cores and 16 threads. In terms of specifications and operating frequencies, the Core i9-11900K has a base frequency of 3.5 GHz, while it has a 'turbo' which tops out at 5.3 GHz. At present, Intel's interpretation of Turbo is rather complex and requires digesting in different ways than previously thought.", "As it stands, Intel's Core i9-11900K has five levels of automatic overclocking. This includes the base frequency at default settings, Turbo Boost 2.0 (TB2), Turbo Boost Max 3.0 (TBM3), Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB), and Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT). Below is an overview of what each means:", "In our launch day ", ", we analyzed all of the turbo variants. Focusing on the Core i9-11900K, which we will be overclocking and testing in this article, we can see below that the Thermal Velocity boost enabled two cores to operate at 5.3 GHz. In contrast, the remaining cores fluctuated between 5.1 GHz and 4.8 GHz with what Intel calls Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT).", "Looking at the Turbo Boost 2.0 frequencies on the Core i9-11900K, every core will operate a 4.7 GHz when all cores are loaded. If there is power and thermal budget available to use, then it will attempt 4.8 GHz, then 4.9 GHz, and so forth. This is what we like to call a 'floating turbo' as it is influenced by thermal and power budgets, which means users with more aggressive CPU coolers are more likely to see higher performance than those using more modest forms of CPU cooling such as smaller air coolers. This is a very similar method and implementation to AMD's Precision Boost 2 technology, which was introduced in April 2018 with Zen+.", "Taking all the turbo boost technologies away from the equation and instead focusing on the base frequency, an overclock of 5.1 GHz all-cores on the Core i9-11900K over the 3.5 GHz base frequency equates to around 45%, which could be impressive if ABT wasn't involved. If using the Turbo Boost 2.0 (TB2) of 4.7 GHz all-cores, the same 5.1 GHz overclock on all-cores is around 8-9%, which is meager in comparison. This is beneficial for novice users that intend to run the processor without making any out-of-the-box adjustments. Still, there's very little headroom in the grand scheme of things for the true enthusiasts among us due to these implementations.", "Similar to how people 'tune' car engines for maximum power and performance gains, many people within this industry use their skills and talent to push computer hardware to the limits. Usually tied to motherboard manufacturers for the most skilled overclockers, people such as HiCookie (GIGABYTE), and Kingp!n (EVGA), actually compete at a high level on the world stage at overclocking events over the year for world records, and in a lot of cases, bragging rights for their respective affiliations. ", "", "While it is entirely possible to get a decent overclock using ambient cooling methods such as water cooling, air cooling, and by using closed loop liquid coolers, the limitation here is never being able to cool below the ambient room temperature. Overclocking by increasing voltages and frequencies generates heat, and you need something to remove the heat, and sometimes the ambient temperture just won't do, even in the Swedish mountains (or Sheffield). The biggest overclocking records come when using more extreme methods such as sub-ambient cooling, the most popular of which includes Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) and dry ice (DICE), which are pretty chill, but also Single-Stage and Multi-Stage Phase Change Change coolers, which use refrigeration equipment to keep the silicon cold. ", "As we're overclocking using a warm running platform, we felt it appropriate to get some upgraded cooling that's currently available at retail to all users. Our cooler of choice is Cooler Master's Masterliquid ML360 Sub-Zero edition cooler, which uses Thermoelectric Unit (TEC) technology to help achieve the lowest possible temperatures. This uses 'Intel's Cryo Cooling Technology' which it states is intelligent sub-ambient cooling with a dynamically managed condensation risk. It adapts around temperatures to avoid this and protect the hardware. Intel and Cooler Master built this together as a way to push processors like Rocket Lake further for end users.", "", "special sauce comes in the form of an integrated TEC, which uses electricity to create a plate with one side cold (on the CPU) and one side warm. The warm side is attached to a closed loop liquid cooler. In order to cool a 200W CPU, this means you need 200W of cooling from the TEC, and that also has to be powered. As a result, the ML360 Sub-Zero is that it requires an 8-pin PCIe cable, so one thing to take into consideration is the additional power draw from the cooler. We measured up to 200 W additional power from the cooler alone in our testing, so if someone is looking to purchase this cooler for their Rocket Lake setup, leave an additional 200 W of power headroom from the power supply. ", "Thermoelectric cooling, or TEC by name, is a solution that applies voltage to generate heat across a TEC plate made of a conductive material and coated in layers of ceramic.

As such, legendary overclocker and ASRock employee Nick Shih has overseen the design and creation of one of the best series of motherboards for overclocking. The OC Formula has been ASRock's brand for their pinnicle performance motherboards for generations - it seemed dead as we hand't seen it in a while, but it as come back with some blazing style.

This was followed up with Z97, Z170, X99, and X299 versions - the last one in 2017. Then the brand went to sleep. We cried out for a reboot on twiiter, to no response at the time. But Nick was waiting in the wings. ", "Nick Shih, ASRock's in-house overclocker, has overseen the design of them all. There are official overclocking ranking leagues, and he has sat on the top.

For the OC Formula, the last 'mainstream' model was the very popular Z170M, a model ", " because our motherboard coverage was skewing ASRock for the year and we wanted to balance it out. It is perhaps one of the most desirable boards for sub-zero and breaking world records there has been since the launch of Intel's Skylake back in 2015. Even I have been scouting for one for my personal collection to no avail.", "With all that in mind, when ASRock announced the Z590 OC Formula was coming to market and offered us a sample, it was important to put all of that to the back of my mind and approach the board with a neutral perspective. If there's been one constant in all our OC Formula reviews, it's that balance between being suitable for a more common market and its overclocking potential - a system fully pivoted to overclocking would not be a good consumer product. The state of overclocking has changed since ASRock's last OCF launch, and one of the reasons we published ", " and mulitple Z590 boards before we got to the OC Formula. ", "While the previous generations of OC Formula's have had an iconic vibrant yellow and black theme, the latest ASRock Z590 OC Formula opts for a flashier metallic yellow (almost gold) with lots of integrated RGB LED lighting for users to create a custom look. Conventional PC users looking to build a system around the ASRock Z590 OC Formula will find a formidable yet premium desktop-based feature set. ", "For an overclocking-focused model, it does include a lot of what the 'regular' Z590 motherboards include, such as three M.2 slots, including one with support for the fastest available PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe drives.

Networking includes a typical premium 2.5 GbE port, a Gigabit port, and Intel's latest Wi-Fi 6E CNVi for users planning on connecting to the internet wirelessly. Other features include a fairly premium HD audio codec and DAC pairing, which takes care of the integrated audio and plenty of USB options on the rear panel. Despite there being no USB 3.2 G2x2 Type-C on the rear panel, there is a regular 10 Gbps Type-C port there, but users wanting 20 Gbps can use a front panel header to achieve this if the chassis used supports this as it is a premium feature of Z590.", "Perhaps the biggest feature set akin to the ASRock Z590 OC Formula is within the strong overclocking feature set, which coincides with the pedigree given by the other OC Formula boards in the past. This is also ever-present in the memory department, as the Z590 OC Formula, according to ASRock, supports up to DDR4-6000 in its specifications. This is done over two memory slots, which will also help those competing in the leagues to dial in some quick memory timings without interference of 2 memory slots per channel. Despite the larger than usual E-ATX size, the PCB is an intentional ploy by ASRock to improve memory performance when using extreme cooling methods such as liquid nitrogen or dry ice. Other overclocking-focused elements on the OC Formula include a robust and plentiful overclockers toolkit and a dedicated LN2 mode dip switch that users can enable or disable depending on the cooling type used.", "Looking at performance, the Z590 OC Formula performed respectably in our stock performance test suite, including compute, gaming, and our system-focused tests. We saw a higher power draw in both long idle and idle power states than other Z590 models tested, but the OC Formula did well at full-load. The ASRock breezed through our non-UEFI POST time testing and DPC latency with solid results in both of these tests. Sometimes an overclocking focused motherboard rejects having a good baseline performance mode, but the OC Formula ticks the box that means that even without tweaking, it can work for everyone.", "With overclocking being the thing that is meant to set the OC Formula apart from 'regular' Z590 models, we saw very tight VDroop control throughout all of our testing. We even managed to hit 5.3 GHz all-core stable with our Core i9-11900K, which only a small handful of models have achieved so far, although we were hit by thermals rather than board limits. We also saw good thermal efficiency in our VRM thermal testing, with the OC Formula sitting as one of the best boards we've tested so far.

The new chipset moves to double bandwidth to the CPU, allowing for more hardware to make the most of the chipset at once. It also moves to DDR4-3200 support, a new peak in a product line that was previously on DDR4-2933.

There are two (or three)big differences between the new Z590 and the previous flagship Z490.", "First up is the CPU-to-chipset link, which has been doubled from a DMI x4 link to a DMI x8 link. This means an effective CPU-to-chipset bandwidth of a PCIe 3.0 x8 link, and suggests that two PCIe 3.0 x4 drives can be attached and run at full speed.Out of all the 500-series chipsets, we are under the impression that Z590 is the only one that will do this, with all others forcing an x4 link. Also, the x8 link only works with Rocket Lake CPUs, and will downgrade to x4 with a previous generation processor.", "The second big difference is that the Z590 platform will enable the processor to use PCIe 4.0. Intel will include native CPU PCIe 4.0 support for the first time, 20 lanes of it, which will enable a full x16 link for add-in cards as well as another PCIe 4.0 x4 for storage. Vendors will be able to split that x16 as required, similar to previous mainstream motherboards, into an x8/x8 or x8/x4/x4 bifurcated solution, with appropriate muxing.", "The third update is native USB 3.2 G2x2 (20 Gbps) Type-C support from the chipset. Motherboards that take advantage of this feature will likely enable it either on a front panel or rear panel connector, although it is optional and some of the cheaper models might not have the port.", "Intel is also offering better memory support on its 11th Generation processors, which have been upgraded from DDR4-2933 to DDR4-3200. This means that motherboard vendors are building the base specifcation to meet this DDR4-3200 at JEDEC specifications, but most will go beyond this for overclocked memory. Due to the ratio jump, it means that we have motherboards offering up to DDR4-5333, although buying that memory will cost a lot of money.

Vendors will enable this through Intel's latest AX201 or AX210 Wi-Fi 6 RF modules, or the new Intel Killer AX1675 (because if you hadn't heard, Intel purchased the company behind the Killer networking chips).", "For wired connectivity, Intel identifies support for 2.5 gigabit Ethernet as a key feature for the new chipsets, however this isn't anything special, as it works the same as in previous generations - motherboard vendors just buy a 2.5 GbE PCIe chip and attach it to the chipset. Though usually when Intel advertises it like this, then there's a combo sale for vendors who buy the chipset along with the Intel branded network controller, so we're going to see a push for 2.5 GbE networking on Z590.", "Another new feature found on Z590 models is Intel's Maple Ridge Thunderbolt 4 connectivity. Despite there being little difference between Thunderbolt 4 and the previous Thunderbolt 3, as both allow for 40 GBs of bandwidth and both can drive additional displays, TB4 does offer the full specification standard. Thunderbolt 4 comes with additional security through Intel VT-d DMA protection, can support longer cables with lengths of up to 2 meters, and also tree/branch daisy chaining, whereas previously only linear chaining was supported.", "Another benefit for users looking to attach extra screens is Thunderbolt 4 can support up to two 4K and one 8K display, which is a marked improvement over Thunderbolt 3.

Originally launched alongside the Ryzen 3000 series processors, AMD has since unveiled its latest Zen 3 based Ryzen 5000 series, and we observed up to 5 GHz frequencies when we tested our processors. Offering support for both the Ryzen 5000 and 3000 series processors, X570 is still AMD's flagship consumer chipset with plenty of PCIe 4.0 support through its full-length PCIe slots and M.2 slots. For users considering B550, chipset-based PCIe 4.0 is the major benefit here.", "One of the models launched back when X570 was announced is the ASUS ROG Strix X570-E Gaming, so even though it has been out a while, it has been a popular option and we wanted to test it. Representing the ROG Strix series that caters to the mid-range, it focuses on blending modern aesthetics with RGB, premium controller sets and features. The X570-E follows a similar design to the vast majority of its Strix branded models, with futuristic graffiti across the heatsinks, with RGB LEDs integrated into the rear panel cover and chipset heatsinks.", "Like other mid-range X570 models, the ASUS is using active cooling for its chipset, with two PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 slots with heatsinks branching out from the heatsink. It uses the full allocation of SATA ports from the chipset with eight in total, with support for RAID 0, 1, and 10 arrays. Looking at PCIe, it has three full-length PCIe 4.0 slots that operate at x16, x8/x8, and x8/x8/+x4, with two PCIe 4.0 x1 slots. Memory support is also impressive with up to DDR4-4400 supported out of the box, with a maximum capacity of up to 128 GB across four memory slots.", "Other interesting inclusions come in the networking stack, with a Realtek 2.5 GbE and an Intel Wi-Fi 6 module. This gears the board up for when 2.5 G Ethernet becomes normalized, with 2.5 G looking to become the standard going forward. It also includes an Intel Gigabit Ethernet port too, with a premium Realtek based ASUS branded audio codec, with lots of USB 3.2 G2 also on the rear panel. This includes seven USB 3.2 G2 Type-A and one USB 3.2 G2 Type-C port. It also provides two video outputs on the rear panel for users planning on installing any of AMD's Ryzen based APUs, including the 3000-series. ", "Looking at performance, the ROG Strix X570-E Gaming performs superbly in our system tests. It combines good power consumption performance with some of the fast booting times into Windows from an AM4 board on the test that we've seen, as well as the best DPC latency out of the box I've seen so far.

{"title": "Hands-On with the ASUS Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WiFi", "paragraph": ["One of the criticisms levied at AMD last year was that it released its new Threadripper Pro platform in September but it was vendor-locked at the time to the Lenovo Thinkstation P620. The P620 seems to have sold like hot cakes, and the system design is really neat (we have one in for testing), but the fact that interested parties only have Lenovo as an option was considered a limiting factor for some. Fast forward to the beginning of 2021, and AMD has announced that TR Pro will be made available at retail, allowing other OEMs to also build systems. Alongside this, three motherboard manufacturers have also showcased their upcoming motherboard offerings, and the most anticipated model that received the most plaudits on looks alone was the ASUS. Today, in what appears to be a worldwide exclusive, we have some hands-on access to the ASUS Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WiFi. Yes, it’s a mouthful to say.", "First thing I noticed when the motherboard was delivered was just how heavy it is. On the scales, the board and box comes to 5.4 kg (11.9 lbs), and the board is most of that. I don’t even think my heaviest laptop weighs that much, and this is a lot more than the motherboard that ASUS made for Intel’s overclockable 28-core Xeon W-3175X a couple years ago. It’s hard to get across in words on a page about the weight, but put it this way, it can replace some dumbbells that is for sure.", "Part of what makes this board so heavy is the size, with this model being a full extended ATX (E-ATX) unit, but also ASUS has built in some proper rigidity support and cooling. On the rear there is a stiffening plate to ensure that the board does not bend when large coolers and add-in cards are being used.", "On the front the 16-phase power delivery has this big chunk of anodized metal on top of it that looks to be able to absorb a lot of heat energy. I took this heatsink off the motherboard and weighed it, and it comes in at just shy of 300 grams (0.6 lbs) on its own.", "Moving back to that 16-phase power delivery – ASUS has transposed the socket such that the airflow moves across the board, through the memory, and out of the panel IO. This means that the power delivery is aligned differently on the board, and ASUS has provided more than enough here for the Threadripper Pro CPUs. In fact, it is very much overkill – we see modern 240 W EPYC systems built with only six phases per socket being plenty, so the fact that ASUS has gone for 16 here, on a chip that doesn’t have CPU overclocking, seems a bit over the top. I guess one factor in that might be because these boards won’t always be in server-like builds, and might have to deal with a poor airflow consumer chassis. Though anyone buying this should be thinking about also getting a decent case.", "It should be noted that this motherboard is somewhat unique by having three 8-pin CPU connectors, rather than the usual two. Most power supplies won’t come with enough cables or support for three 8-pin CPU connectors, so users must be wary of this requirement. That being said, out of the three headers on the board for these connectors, ASUS has seen fit to reinforce two of them with additional armor support, but not the third. I wonder if the two reinforced ones are actually the ones required for the CPU, and the third is for additional power to the motherboard.", "Sticking with cooling, the chipset is covered by a heatsink that is somewhat/but not really connected to the power delivery heatsink, and inside is a fan with a simple metal grille on top. Users might have to get in here to remove dust every now and again, as I can see this grille being filled with dust in the wrong environments.", "Underneath this heatsink is the chipset, which has the code 100-CG3090. Now we know that the X570 chipset has the code 100-CG3091, and the TRX40 chipset has the code 100-CG3089, so this looks very much to be a near identical copy of one of those. That means eight lanes of PCIe 4.0 up to the CPU for bandwidth, and a number of options coming from the chipset for additional IO.", "The socket on this board is a standard AMD large LGA-4094 socket, as used with all previous EPYC and TR processors to date, though obviously with the chipset this seems to be locked down to TR Pro CPUs only. Alongside the socket there are eight DDR4-3200 slots, enabling 8-channel memory. Technically TR Pro supports up to 2 TB of memory, though only in 2 DIMMs per channel mode, so the most users can put in here is likely going to be 1 TB with 128 GB LRDIMMs (256 GB LRDIMMs exist, but are quite rare).", "With 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes, there are lots of connectivity options. The easiest way to see this is with the seven full PCIe 4.0 x16 slots on the board, all with reinforced slot armor. Because PCIe 4.0 has limitations on trace length in a PCB, ASUS has had to use some PCIe 4.0 repeaters to get the signal to the bottom slots, but that’s all built in and should work as expected. There are two 6-pin PCIe connectors on the motherboard to help assist the board in supplying 75W of power to all the slots should they all be used at once. Also using PCIe lanes are the three M.2 slots supporting PCIe 4.0 x4 drives, and dual U.2 ports as well. There is an Intel X550-AT2 chipset for dual 10 GbE on the rear panel also using PCIe.", "For storage, along with the dual U.2 and triple M.2 there are eight SATA ports. For of these come from the chipset, with the other four supplied by ASMedia ASM1061 controllers.", "On the rear panel, ASUS has enabled a complete set of USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) support, with eight USB Type-A ports and a Type-C port. There is a second Type-C port, and this goes to 20 Gbps with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. There’s no USB 2.0 on this rear panel! Alongside these ports are the dual 10 GbE networking ports, Wi-Fi 6 support (we’re told there will be a version of this board without Wi-Fi, for OEMs at least), the Clear CMOS and BIOS Flashback buttons, and the audio outputs coming from the custom ASUS Realtek codec.", "The rear panel also has its own dedicated air baffle and shroud to help with cooling and air flow, with an additional fan located in the back here as well.", "Unfortunately because this was a quick loaner board not directly from ASUS and we had to give back immediately, it was requested that we don’t spend time testing the board. It is perhaps best if we wait for ASUS’ press/retail sample, rather than test this unit that actually belongs to a local OEM that is designing systems around it. I’d rather not have the opportunity for it to break in my hands in that instance!", "Exact availability and pricing is unknown at this point. The last big motherboard ASUS did, for the W-3175X, was close to around $1500 at retail, and the company just announced an $1800 motherboard for Z590, and so it’s hard to place what exactly this TR Pro system will cost, with all the bells and whistles, but no need for overclocking. I’m going to think that for a retail cost it would be very much in that $1200-$1800 range, if not more. Initial units might also be headed to OEMs first, so end-users looking to build their own TR Pro systems might have to wait a bit.", "Update: Reports are coming in that the motherboard will be south of 1000 Euros. Compared to some of ASUS' other offerings, this comes in fairly cheap by comparison.", "The name of ‘Threadripper Pro’ is a bit of a misnomer – AMD is using the name because the Threadripper brand already has traction in the markets these processors are aimed at, such as the rendering and animation studios already loaded up on TR but want more memory support and PCIe lanes.", "These new TR Pro CPUs are more akin to ‘Workstation EPYC’, as they are more like the EPYC processors (EPYC with higher TDP but slightly reduced DRAM support) rather than the Threadrippers (TR then add ECC support, 8x DRAM support, double PCIe 4.0, DASH manageability).", "There are two main processors as part of this family, coming in at 64-core and 32-core. AMD has also seen the need to fill out the lower rungs of the stack, with a 16-core and a rather odd 12-core model. These are all based on AMD’s Zen 2 architecture, using the TSMC N7 process, come in at 280 W TDP, and support DDR4-3200, 128 lanes of PCIe 4.0, and the new WRX80 chipset.", "From our conversations with OEMs, the top three processors are going to be what is widely available. That unique 12-core variant seems to be a part for specific partners, with the OEMs I’ve been speaking to not even having the chance to order it from AMD (the alternative is that the 12-core isn’t ready yet, which I find hard to believe).", "Exact retail pricing for these processors has not been officially announced, however it is expected to fall in line somewhere between the Threadripper and EPYC variants for those that have near identical comparisons, or perhaps slightly above EPYC, given the 280W TDP. That means the 64-core TR Pro 3995WX is likely to be somewhere above $3990 (the TR 3990X) and around the $4425 (EPYC 7702P). Some leaks have suggested this model will be nearer $5000, which may also be down to supply.", "Update: Prices are now known, and have been added to the table.", "Launch date for these processors is expected to be sooner rather than later. AMD has already stated that it will be launching its new EPYC 7003 ‘Milan’ series processors in March, so I’d expect these parts to be made available before they announce the new enterprise architecture.", " "]},

More detail inside the review.", "Our experience when overclocking was also competitive - it's just as good as the more expensive X570 models we have tested. Despite the lack of an integrated VRM temperature sensor, the B550-F Gaming performed very well in our VRM thermal testing with a recorded temperature of between 50 and 52 degrees Celsius on our two calibrated K-type probes. Using our FLIR thermal imaging camera, we measured 54.9 degrees celsius on the hottest part of the CPU socket area and power delivery, which is cooler than most. ", "Perhaps due to motherboard vendor 'eagerness', the number of B550 motherboards in the sub-$200 price range is perhaps lower than anticipated, especially as we look back at previous B-series motherboard prices. The added expense is due to a couple of things, mainly through what it takes to create official support for PCIe 4.0, and for this generation most vendors have added considerably better networking support, even more so than some X570 models at similar price points. This makes B550 attractive to the mid-range in that $200 segment, with more budget B550 models starting from $150 range starting to come to market.", "The ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi has an MSRP of $210, with the non-Wi-Fi 6 version available for $190. On paper this makes both models solid contenders for anyone looking to build a solid B550 based gaming system. The competition at the price point includes the B550 Gaming Carbon Wifi ($220) which includes a very similar feature set with a Realtek based 2.5 GbE Ethernet controller instead of an Intel one, and there are also a number of GIGABYTE offerings in the mix. ", "Read on for our extended analysis and comparison tests."]},

Over the years motherboard vendors have been perfecting their small form factor models designed to offer all of the performance of the larger-sized models, but with a smaller desktop footprint. Of these, two of the most desirable models based on features and pricing from all the mini-ITX models on the Z490 chipset are the GIGABYTE Z490I Aorus Ultra and MSI MEG Z490I Unify. Offering dual PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots, 2.5 GbE Ethernet ports, and integrated Wi-Fi 6 radios, both GIGABYTE and MSI's motherboards are designed to address the high end of the market. And with both boards going for the same price as well, it's easy to see why these Z490 boards have become such worthy adversaries.", "Focusing on the two motherboards in our review, both models have similar feature sets and the same MSRP of $270. There is only a handful of Z490 mini-ITX boards currently available, with a couple of entry-level models, as well as some mid to high-end models like the pair we have for review today. Overall, the six mini-ITX Z490 boards that are on the market today range in price from $160 to $300, with both the GIGABYTE Z490I Aorus Ultra and MSI MEG Z490I Unify coming with an MSRP of $270.", "On paper, both models are quite similar in specifications, with a 10-layer PCB featured on both, and near-identical power delivery systems based on Intersil 90 A power stages. The most significant difference, aside from aesthetics and minor details, are that the MSI MEG Z490I Unify also includes an Intel Thunderbolt 3 controller, which is one of the features more commonly associated with flagship Z490 boards.

These processors will also have the same LGA1200 socket as these motherboards but clearly will have access to some form of PCIe 4.0 compatibility. This means that the motherboards have to be built with Rocket Lake in mind. That being said, we assume that Rocket Lake hasn't even been built yet - or at least, even the early stage silicon is probably not ready. This means that the motherboard vendors have to work on specifications and standards provided by Intel, some of which could possibly change by release, but also some of these specifications could drastically vary from Comet Lake (10th Gen) to Rocket Lake (11th Gen?).", "We already know that PCIe 4.0 is a differentiating factor, but what about the number of PCIe lanes? Comet Lake only supports 16 lanes from the processor, and so most of these Z490 boards are built with that in mind. But if Rocket Lake supports more, say 20 PCIe lanes from the processor, then that leaves four lanes to add an M.2. In order to support this M.2 slot from the CPU on Z490, the motherboard vendors have to put in the required switches such that the slot works on both Comet Lake in PCIe 3.0 mode and Rocket Lake in PCIe 4.0 mode. Either that or disable the slot completely for Comet Lake, because it would end up reducing the main PCIe slot to an x8 due to bifurcation.", "This is but one example, but depending on memory support, power support, graphics support - all of these mean that motherboard manufacturers can take Z490 in one of two ways. The one that most vendors seem to be doing is to make their boards hybrids - suitable for both Comet and Rocket, but not really mastering one. For users intending to upgrade mid-cycle without a motherboard change, these hybrid designs are probably best. The second option is to make specific boards for the specific chips, despite technically supporting both: making the Z490 the best board it can be for Comet Lake, and then some future board (Z590?) being the best board for Rocket Lake. Personally, I prefer the latter, because I'd like the best out of my processor. However, prices of the best motherboards are matching (or even surpassing) that of the processor, which makes the quandary a little more complex than on first glance.", "With the release of Intel's 10th generation Comet Lake CPU's offering multiple processors ranging from dual-core Celerons to the latest 10-core i9-10900K SKUs, the demand on motherboard vendors to improve on existing designs is paramount. The onus is on motherboard vendors to deliver to its target markets, whether it's gaming which Intel claims the Core i9-10900K and i9-10900KF to be the best gaming processors ever, but content creation is bigger than it has ever been too. There are seven motherboards with Thunderbolt 3, for example.", "Below is the current Z490 product stack which has been announced for launch, with some models not expected to hit shelves until later on.

{"title": "First ATX12VO Consumer Motherboard: The ASRock Z490 Phantom Gaming 4SR", "paragraph": ["One of the biggest legacy characteristics of the modern PC is how the power supply connects to the motherboard – not only is it one big chunky 24-pin power connector in to the board, but it has to supply all of the relevant voltages, including 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V. Over the last two decades, standards that used 5 V and 3.3 V have almost disappeared, except for a last few legacy applications. Despite that, we’ve been lumbered with the old ATX12V standard for this. However recently the ATX12VO standard was announced, requiring only 12 V into the motherboard and other voltages to be derived from it on the board. This also allows the power supply to be more efficient and compact, with a smaller connector. At the time, given the ubiquity of the ATX12V standards, we were all under the impression that ATX12VO would be something for the embedded market, where the full hardware stack could be customized top-to-bottom.

They have now put up a product page for this board, the ASRock Z490 Phantom Gaming 4SR.", "", "In ", ", the company states that the new ATX12VO standard will help substantially with idle power of a PC, due to the single rail design not needing to cater for other voltages other than 12 V. The company states that governments will benefit a lot from this, given that the standard complies with upcoming standards for electronic efficiency in the US and Japan. It notes that while there have been single rail custom designs in the past, this new industry standard will allow vendors to unite under a single implementation. One of the key partners for this is ASRock, who state that they are Intel’s primary partner on this project.", "On the face of it, the new ", " looks very much like what a user should expect from a Z490 motherboard, with a socket, power delivery, PCIe slots, and other additional controllers.

In the case of the ASRock board, we have four SATA connections and an M.2 slot.", "What makes this perhaps a little strange is that although this new ATX12VO standard is aimed at the lower power parts of the market and the more embedded designs, ASRock has made this a full Z490 board. It supports overclocking and fast memory, it has better gold-pin plating in the DRAM slots, there’s an ALC1200 audio codec, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and so on. That being said, the PCIe slot layout is only x16 from the CPU and x4 from the chipset, rather than an x8/x8 design.", "As to when this motherboard goes on sale, we’re not quite sure – very likely it will be region limited as well.

With our CPU, the power consumption figures were very reasonable with a maximum of 140 W at the wall under load in our Prime95 Blend test, which given all of the controllers onboard means that the board is more power-conscious than the MSI MEG X570 Ace or MSI MEG X570 Godlike. Booting into Windows was relatively quick and the results for the X570 Aqua sit in the middle-ground of our X570 results. The only result in our computational performance-related benchmarks came in our DigiCortex 1.20 benchmark. All the gaming and compute benchmarks were as expected.", "Moving onto the overclocking performance of the ASRock X570 and our Ryzen 7 3700X performs well. ASRock doesn't include any preset overclocking profiles to work from, so all of the major overclocks need to be done manually. Looking at VDroop when manually overclocking and we see that ASRock at 1.250 V on the CPU VCore at 3.6 to 4.2 GHz performs exactly where we expected it to be with a consistent variation of 0.031 V from set to load value. At 4.3 GHz with a 1.350 V CPU VCore has less VDroop with a variation of just 0.019 V at full load. Our Ryzen 7 3700X processor doesn't like 4.4 GHz with any amount of CPU VCore at maximum load, although we did manage to POST into Windows 10 without issues; any notable load would crash the CPU. Also, ASRock includes the same Eco mode within the firmware which we saw with the ", ", but any attempt to place CPU load under Prime95 would instantly crash the system.", "The ASRock X570 Aqua isn't for everyone and users looking opt for the monolithic E-ATX aluminium clad model will have to use a custom water cooling loop at the very least. This will add a further cost on top of the $999 premium ASRock is charging for its X570 Aqua, which will see just 999 be made available to the general public. As it stands there is no direct competitor with a monoblock unless GIGABYTE decides to release a version of its ", " via an Aorus WaterForce model. The $999 price tag is not only impressive-looking, but it also includes 10 G, Wi-Fi 6, and dual Thunderbolt 3 Type-C outputs. One thing that also has to be factored into the price is exclusivity; there are only 999 units available for purchase. If this works well with the audience, then rarity would add a price premium. Of course, price is relative to what a user is willing to pay, but the overall package and presentation make the Aqua feel as high-end as the cost suggests.", "Ultimately those looking at the Aqua are going to be money-no-object users, or OEMs/companies wanting to build halo systems to show off their skills in system building. But, it doesn't mean we can't have some fun and analyse this thing. It may not be practical from the raw cost, but it does show that passion still exists in this industry.", "Read on for our extended analysis."]},

The ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme also includes support for DDR4-4733, with up to 256 GB in quad-channel mode supported across eight memory slots.", "Focusing on the performance, the ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme is very competitive with other TRX40 models we've tested. It does run with a slightly higher power draw than other models, but with a LiveDash 1.7 OLED screen, plenty of integrated RGB, a premium controller set, and extra cooling fans for the power delivery, this is to be expected. The biggest win for the second iteration of the Zenith Extreme was in our  POST test, with the ASUS model performing very well.

While not much separates both models on paper, it all comes down to the aesthetics and ultimately, the performance. The ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme is a solid example of a premium flagship on what is one of the most talked-about platforms all year. Comparing pricing to AMD's more consumer-focused desktop X570 chipset, flagships from vendors on both X570 and TRX40 are similar in terms of price ($800-900), and with the added cost of an AMD Ryzen 3rd generation Threadripper processor factored in, ASUS is aiming high with the Zenith II Extreme, and it certainly shows in the feature set and the aesthetics.", "Read on for our extended analysis."]},

These parts, assumed to be aimed at ‘casual’ and ‘workstation’ users, have formed the basis of many rumors and a lot of speculation, especially on the back of TRX40 which does exist for the latest generation of AMD Threadripper CPUs. Similarly, recent news has been posted about the potential existence of a theoretical LGA1159 socket for Intel, despite the fact that LGA1200 is often cited as the next generation socket for upcoming Comet Lake processors on the desktop. We reached out to a few contacts while we were here at CES to put some weight into these rumors, to confirm them one way or the other, for good.", "It’s at this point I want to talk about sources. For anyone who has studied journalism, or even history at a high school level, there is the concept of sources carrying different amounts of weight. A primary source, for example, would be a direct participant in an event who would be able to recount with specific detail what they did/saw or what is planned. A secondary source might be a journalist collating or analyzing data from primary sources, a piece of software including a list of details about other products, or an artist depicting the events taking place from information they have collected. Tertiary sources go beyond this, and might involve individuals discussing an event without any direct experience of a specific instance.

So in order to find out when these two AMD eight-channel chipsets were going to come out, as well as the existence of yet another consumer Intel socket, I naturally went to ask AMD, Intel, as well as their primary partners and OEMs. The partners and OEMs that work with Intel and AMD are involved in developing and selling future platforms, and as such they have insight into the next 6-9 months of products coming into the market. They also have ideas about the 9-18 month schedule, but as we’ve seen in the past, that is often subject to change.

The answer I got was very clear cut from everyone I talked to: no-where on their roadmaps has it ever said TRX80, WRX80, or LGA1159. None of the companies I talked had even heard of these names, let alone had any products with these features in the pipeline.", "On the LGA1159 socket, one source actually knew what I was talking about, at least to some degree. They stated that the reason why people are confused here is that Intel distributed some early engineering samples of six-core Comet Lake CPUs in LGA1150 packaging, and those photographs got leaked onto the internet. The reason Intel could do this is that there's next to no difference between Coffee Lake Refresh and Comet Lake silicon, and as a result some early testing could be done. However, the same source also showed us the different packaging for the 10-core engineering sample, where the layout is somewhat different. As it stands, this is the issue with assuming what you see is always going to be at retail - if the fact that something is an engineering sample isn't taken into account, perhaps you shouldn't write about every rumor you see or hear.", "But does this mean that there will never be a product called TRX80, WRX80, or have the LGA1159 socket? No. But what I am told from my sources is that as it stands these products have never existed. There might be a future LGA1159 socket for Intel CPUs, or future upgraded motherboards for AMD CPUs, but as it stands, all of my contacts confirmed that none of them exist on roadmaps today.", "It should be pointed out that our sources did request anonymity. This is par for the course for this sort of response, even when confirming when a particular ‘product’ doesn’t exist. Should these sources be able to provide information about actual future products, and I may wish to call upon them again, and they'd rather not act as a magnet for future questions from all the other tech media."]},

Three of the full-length slots share bandwidth with three of the PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots, so there is some muxing involved. There are four PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots, each featuring its own heatsink. Users looking to use these in RAID with Intel (and other approved) drives can do so, as Supermicro includes a VROC RAID key within its software bundle for RAID 0 and 1 support. For SATA drives and devices, there are eight SATA ports which support RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10 arrays. ", "Looking at the networking on the Supermicro X11SPA-T, there are three Ethernet controllers; one Aquantia AQC107 10 G, one Intel I210-AT Gigabit, and a Realtek RTL8211E PHY dedicated to the boards integrated BMC/IPMI chip.

With a touch screen interface, a user could also apply settings, or overclock on the fly. Another concept for this display is that it would be detachable, like a smart home electric system. The display would be connected to a Wi-Fi module on the system that had the correct hooks to do these changes.", "Behind the display module there are no PCIe slots. Instead we get four M.2 slots for storage, connected to the main chipset heatsink with an all-around shroud. The all-around shroud for the motherboard helps unify the design but can also apply some cooling efficiencies or EMI protection. The shroud hides the rear panel, where ASUS has upgraded its idea for a disaggregated / swappable rear IO platform. We saw this before on ASUS’ project Avalon SFF PC, whereby users could swap between a workstation focused rear IO, or a music focused one, or a storage focused one etc. In this instance, ASUS has made each of the rear panel features individually selectable.", "In the long term, this is all controller based – it would rely on the add-in devices to have PCIe-to-X controllers for each of the USB ports, Ethernet, Thunderbolt, audio and such, and given that some of those devices require more than one lane, could be tricky when it comes to mix-and-match. This is a problem that could go away by PCIe 5.0 it should be noted, where a number of regular features immediately become a single PCIe 5.0 lane.", "For the regular PCIe slots, ASUS has put these on the rear of the motherboard. Obviously there’s a small amount of lane re-organization to make this happen, but the idea is that with the motherboard in this configuration, the CPU and SSDs can be on one side of the system, while the GPUs can be on the other. ASUS hasn’t yet said how this motherboard would be installed into a case, which might be interesting in its own right.", " ", "The final new feature is a proprietary fan header for ASUS’ new Hydra Cortex fan arrangements. The single header can be used to daisy chain fans together and yet still control each fan in the chain independently.", "As mentioned, I’m a big fan of these technology showcases and one-off designs. It shows that a company has engineers willing to think outside the box and put their skills into the system to create something new. Motherboard innovation isn’t dead, we just limited by form factor and scale. The Prime Utopia won’t be coming to market, but I’m glad it exists."]},

As with every platform, Intel released (although this time several months later) a second wave of cheaper chipsets, allowing buyers to purchase inexpensive motherboards for the latest processors. These motherboards are not always for the enthusiasts, but will allow users to enter the platform at a lower price. To that end, all board partners have several boards in the H370, B350, and H310 chipsets to choose from. ", "The GIGABYTE B360 AORUS Gaming 3 WIFI in our hands today offers users that lower-cost of entry along with quite a few features. At $120, about the only thing missing from a base Z370 board the Gaming 3 Wi-Fi is the ability to overclock. The board includes lightning fast Wi-Fi capabilities (to 1.73 Gbps) as well as USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) support integrated into the chipset. Many in this market are simply looking for basic features and a pleasing design aesthetic. While it may not have some of the extended shrouding visuals we see higher up the stack, its clear appearance and brushed aluminum heatsinks with orange accents work well for an overall neat system. There's also some RGB LED lighting around the board.", "It takes more than good looks and a solid feature set to entice buyers into purchasing a board, as performance counts even with a locked system. We ran the board through our testing suite to see if the system shines under the hood as well. ", "Overall, the performance testing went without a hitch. Despite most Z370 boards implementing some 'beyond stock' performance, often called Multi-Core Enhancement (MCE), the B360 Gaming 3 WIFI was within striking distance of those that did not use MCE. Where the Gaming 3 WIFI really shined was in the power consumption testing. Compared to the other motherboards we have tested, it consumed around 20W less than the others.", "Regarding other features, the board comes fully equipped with support for two memory modules per channel with total support up to 64 GB and speeds up to DDR4 2666 (memory overclocking is not possible here). For storage connectivity, we see both of the common options of SATA ports as well as dual M.2 slots. The board has a total of six SATA3 ports and unlike its Z370 brothers, the B360 chipset does not support any kind of RAID. Users will have to add that through add-in cards or external solutions. The dual M.2 slots support both PCIe and SATA drives, though it is worth it to note the second slot (at the bottom of the case) only supports PCIe x2 bandwidth. The board does support AMD Crossfire setups across the PCIe lanes through the chipset, but not NVIDIA SLI due to lane burification limits on the platform. ", "For connectivity, the back panel IO gives users a total of four USB 2.0 ports, three USB 3.0 ports (one Type-C), and one USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) port (red Type-A).

Normally, Intel wireless adapters and their RF elements are on a single module that fits into a standard M.2 E-key slot. These chipsets are the first in the mainstream desktop to use Intel's integrated connectivity (through CNVi technology) for wireless networking. This moves the control functions of the Wi-Fi modules into the chipset. The only thing board partners need to do is add a compatible companion RF front-end module, which is cheaper (but still adds about $15 cost to the final price).

As a matter of fact, the list of features is so long that feels as if ASUS's engineers used this design as a project to find out just how many things they can fit on an E-ATX PCB. Some of these features are unique and with usefulness limited to just extreme overclocking, such as liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling hardware support. The current retail price of the ASUS X399 ROG Zenith Extreme at the time of this review is $507, making it by far the most expensive Ryzen Threadripper motherboard currently available, with ASUS clearly hoping to entice the most demanding enthusiasts and overclockers who are seeking the very best regardless of the price tag.", "ASUS designed the X399 ROG Zenith Extreme to be the pinnacle in terms of features and capabilities for the AMD Ryzen Threadripper processor. The list of features is so long that ASUS's engineers had to use an Extended ATX (E-ATX) PCB to fit everything and, still, that was not enough, forcing them to use additional vertical daughterboards. An E-ATX compliant case obviously is necessary to fit this motherboard and we strongly suggest a spacious design because many connectors are facing outward from the edge of the board.", "One of the primary features that differentiate the ASUS X399 ROG Zenith Extreme from the crowd is the presence of six PCIe slots (four full-size PCIe 3.0 slots, one PCIe 2.0 ×4 slot, and one PCIe 2.0 ×1 slot). The motherboard also appears as if it has nine RAM slots but the rightmost slot is not for a RAM module - it is a slot for the included daughterboard that allows for the installation of two M.2 PCIe ×4 devices. There also is a third M.2 PCIe ×4 slot hidden under the chipset's heatsink.", "Checking the motherboard more closely, we noticed the surprising fact that the ASUS X399 ROG Zenith Extreme has only six SATA drive connectors, while every other advanced AMD X399 motherboard has eight. The designer obviously ran out of space and chose to install a U.2 PCIe ×4 port instead of two additional SATA connectors. The U.2 PCIe ×4 port shares its lanes with the fourth last PCIe slot and will be disabled if four graphics cards are installed. If no PCIe device or a PCIe ×1-4 device is installed in the last PCIe slot, the U.2 port will operate normally and can be used in parallel with all three M.2 slots.", "The network connections of the ASUS X399 ROG Zenith Extreme are very interesting. Besides from the standard Intel I211-AT Gigabit Network Interface Controller (NIC), ASUS also provides a PCIe ×4 card with the ROG AREION 10G NIC, which uses the Aquantia AQC107 controller.

One chip controls the small OLED display that is installed on the motherboard's I/O cover, which we will discuss in detail in the following pages. Furthermore, there are switches and jumpers controlling options that are specific to LN2 overclocking, allowing the motherboard to boot under these extreme overclocking conditions.", "A Realtek ALC-S1220 audio codec, the ASUS-specific version of the well-known ALC1220, is the heart of the audio circuitry. It is assisted by an ESS SABRE 9018Q2C digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and features impedance sense on both the front and the rear headphone jacks. ASUS has the audio circuitry electrically isolated from the rest of the PCB and the left/right channels also isolated from each other on different PCB layers.", "In the bundle, ASUS has geared the setup for gamers with plenty of cables and SLI bridges. An added bonus to this setup is that the drivers come on a flash drive, rather than a CD. This is a feature that has been requested for years (very few people have an CD drive any more), however the tight margins on motherboards often outweigh the expense of a small USB stick.

More about StoreMI and how it operates can be found here at ", "For an added bonus, the newer X470 chipset also draws less power (4.8W) than the old chipset (6.8W) at load.", "With the introduction of a new chipset, especially in relation to specific Intel chipsets, overclocking parameters and how overclocking is done usually changes somewhat; usually minor, but sometimes on a wider scale. The good news with the release of the new X470 chipset is that nothing is different whatsoever in relation to AM4 overclocking. Everything from voltages, to the multiplier, all the way to overclocking the base clock, is all the same as far as Ryzen processors go.", "Our particular AMD Ryzen 1700 eight-core processor sample certainly can’t be considered as ‘good’ when it comes to overclocking headroom, but it is capable of 3.90 GHz at 1.375 V on even the most basic of compatible motherboards. This is fully stabled under Prime95 as well as OCCT and as it has been apparent, squeezing out small reductions in used voltage has been possible on boards using better power deliveries and components. An overclock of 3.90 GHz is easily achievable on all but the worst Ryzen silicon.", "With only the CPU core ratio (x39 multiplier) and CPU Vcore voltage manually set to 1.375 V, the system booted into Windows 10 without issue and was stable throughout stress testing and within POV-Ray. With 1.375 V set within the BIOS, CPU-Z read out a CPU core voltage of 1.385 V while under maximum load.", "Referencing back to the Biostar X370GTN review, our Ryzen 7 1700 CPU does have a limitation between 3.9 GHz and 4.0 GHz; at least on the boards we have tested thus far. This is down to silicon lottery and a combination of a sharp ramp of voltage to temperature is present when moving up each different step, especially above 3.70 GHz.", "While an overclock of 4.0 GHz was manageable with our pretty average Ryzen 7 1700 (", ") processor, the proof is in the pudding that going from 3.90 GHz to 4.0 GHz provides good performance, although at the cost of thermals and overall power consumption."]},

This means modifying the components, having a super streamlined OS, and to a certain extent be a money-no-object scenario.", "One of the things that overclocking does is generate heat, and that needs to be kept under control. Beyond air cooling and water cooling is sub-zero cooling, using items such as dry ice to cool processors for the 20 minutes needed for that special benchmark record. Liquid nitrogen is the favored tool of extreme overclockers, being easy enough to handle and ‘reasonably’ cheap, with the lucky few having played with liquid helium.", "Normally Liquid Nitrogen, as it sublimes from a liquid to a gas, requires an exit: the ability to escape by using an open pot is key to how to get a system to overclock beyond 6 GHz. EVGA has gone crazy, by developing a closed water-loop esque system for liquid nitrogen. I cannot explain how insane this is.", "As shown in the image above, using these coolants invokes moisture, and water is bad for the system.

Truth be told, the other vendors have dozens of engineers working on them, whereas EVGA only has a handful. Despite this, EVGA has slowly crept up to match the other vendors by slowly adding the latest options. For the first time it seems, EVGA now has the march with a new feature not seen on other products. We have seen stress testing before to find the best overclock, but we’ve never seen a direct stress test before.", "The key to what EVGA provides is that users can manually invoke a stress test based on their current configurations while in the BIOS. The stress test will implement a Prime95-like CPU stress, and the BIOS will fire up a display that shows the frequency, voltage, and temperature of the CPU. Normally in the past, we would expect the interface to be slow (because it’s in the BIOS), but EVGA updates the display at a proper refresh rate, showing the live results of the sensors on board.", "The new BIOS is also higher resolution, and has an EZ-mode so users can go into an OC Robot mode (to find a good overclock) or into a Gamer mode focused on what matters for gamers.", "EVGA expects to roll out the new interface very soon, starting with its X299 motherboards first."]},

The first was the launch of the Intel i7-8086K, a six-core limited edition processor at 5 GHz that is coming out later this week. The second was the behemoth: Intel showed a prototype 28-core system running at 5.0 GHz, and stating that it will be coming out at Q4.", "Not a lot else was said, however since the announcement we have dug deep to get some more information, and today we were one of a small handful of press to actually have a chance to get some hands-on with the system on display. Here’s what you need to know.", "The new processor runs in the LGA3647 socket, which is Intel’s Xeon enterprise socket with 3647 pins. These processors are huge, and no consumer motherboards exist for them as the design is purely for servers and enterprise. The platform also supports six memory channels, so we have a hex-memory channel design. This was evidenced by the close up images taken from Intel’s Keynote during Computex.", "At the keynote, Intel also demonstrated a Cinebench R15 score with the processor running at 5.0 GHz on all 28 cores. The benchmark is a common multi-threaded workload to ramp up all cores to a reasonably high load level. The score in the keynote was 7334 points. Working from data taken from Intel’s current 28-core Xeon processor, the Xeon Platinum 8180, shows that the 8180 at 3.34 GHz can achieve a score of 5040. Doing the math and assuming perfect scaling (which Cinebench does well at) shows that the same processor at 5.0 GHz would score around 7560 points. The difference between that number and the 7334 that Intel scored is within the ballpark, so we are likely looking at an overclocked version of the Intel Xeon Platinum 8180.", "At the keynote, systems from ASUS and GIGABYTE were shown, each looking fairly hefty and bulky. As noted previously, the LGA3647 socket is a server socket and platform, so for this 28-core product to be available to consumers, we will have to see some consumer-grade motherboards coming to market. There is a precedent for this – about 10 years ago Intel released a SkullTrail platform, which used two QX9775 processors in a dual processor motherboard that only Intel produced. That platform was mightily expensive, and hard to acquire – only the big boys had access to it. Chances are we will see the same again here.", "On the matter of power consumption – we have seen estimates from our readers about power consumption ranging from 300W all the way up to 1 kW and beyond. Of course this is no ordinary chip, and overclocking it beyond its specifications is going to draw some excessive heat. At the keynote, some zoomed in photographs from our colleagues over at Tom’s Hardware show a very large pile of tubes coming out of the rear of the system. There ends up being two levels of speculation here: either Intel is using a water cooler (likely with a water chiller), or there is phase change cooling in play. The latter relies on sub-zero temperatures, which creates moisture and ice around the socket, and Intel’s demo was fairly clean, so personally I believe that a water chiller is in place. A common water chiller for overclocking can run up to 1500W, although the mid-sized ones are around 500-800W, and can cost a few hundred dollars. That doesn’t give much of an insight into what we are dealing with here, especially as it is an issue about clock speeds.", "At the event, Intel said the CPU reached 5.0 GHz, and the tools on display showed a 5.0 GHz reading on all cores. It was not stated if this was overclocked, however most people have come to the conclusion that the processor was. The Intel Xeon 8180 has a base frequency of 2.5 GHz, a turbo of 3.8 GHz, and an all-core frequency of 3.2 GHz. If we allow for the fact that Intel could likely bin this processor higher, around 3.0 GHz base to 4.0 GHz turbo, then we are looking at a substantial overclock.", "Pricing is still anyone’s guess. If we take the Xeon Platinum 8180 at $10k, then assume that for consumers it might have the ECC part removed (it can also be binned such that QPI doesn’t need to work). Intel has to be wary about what markets this processor might take away in terms of sales, so it has to be priced accordingly. Add ~$1k for a motherboard that can take the power requirements of a 28-core overclocked beast, and at least 6x8 GB (48GB) of DDR4-2666, then we can imagine that a full ‘base’ system could easily come in at $10k or more. However, for the target crowd, such as high-frequency traders, they would perhaps spend $100k on a bespoke super-cooled system. However many CPUs that Intel wanted to manufacturer (or could even bin), each one would sell, and the people that would want it would be prepared to pay the big money. For anyone looking at a $5k pot for their next high-end gaming PC, unfortunately these parts will be for the 1% of the 1%.", "For our sneak peek, we got hands on one of the motherboards that Intel used for the demonstration. According to our sources, only one of the models on display was actually capable of 5 GHz.", "This motherboard is a monster. That’s a standard LGA3647 socket, and this is a E-ATX-like (but custom) form factor. Can you see all those phases along the top?", "I haven’t had time to count them, this news is so rushed. The VRM cooler was copper finned and had four high-powered fans on it.", "There’s plenty of PCIe slots and storage and even some audio, but for a prototype board it is a beast.", "We confirmed that Intel was using a water chiller in the 5 GHz demo, a Hailea HC-1000B, which is a 1 HP water chiller good for 1500-4000 liters per hour and uses the R124 refrigerant to reduce the temperature of the water to 4 degrees Celsius.

If a user wants LEDs for Ryzen at under $200, here is one of the primary contenders. Being part of GIGABYTE's gaming product line means we get SLI support, and GIGABYTE is using a gaming-focused network controller (one of two) and some overclocking options for the processor. The interesting part of this board, however, is the use of dual audio codecs: one for the rear panel and one for the front panel. To physically do this requires a couple of compromises, so we have put the board through its paces to see if it is worth buying.", "To read specifically about the X370/B350 chip/platform and the specifications therein, our deep dive into what it is can be found at ", ".", "The GIGABYTE AX370-Gaming 5 shows that not every motherboard has to conform to the regular gaming themed combination of black PCB with red or silver aluminium heatsinks. With the Gaming 5, it has a wave of black and white contrasting heatsinks featured across the board. GIGABYTE has opted to implement a fairly standard X370 PCIe layout consisting of two full-length PCIe 3.0 slots powered by the CPU, which feature support for dual graphics card configurations on either SLI or CrossFire and have additional rigidity support. This is in addition to a single full-length slot present at the bottom which operates at PCIe 2.0 x4 also with rigidity support, and three PCIe 2.0 x1 slots.", "It gets a little interesting when we start discussing the controllers. Powering the onboard audio are a pair of Realtek ALC1220 codecs, with one dedicated for the back panel and one specifically for the front.

PCIe storage comes via a single U.2 port, which shares bandwidth with a single M.2-2280 slot found between the first two full-length PCIe slots.", "Performance on the Gaming 5 essentially matches what we see on the other X370 boards. Despite the dual audio codecs, this means that each codec only has half of the space, so our audio results show that it is one of the weaker ALC1220 solutions (although better than the ALC892 units we have tested).

The only caveat of this is that virtually every motherboard I have used this with is very cautious about not giving enough voltage, so over-volts the CPU. This gives the overclock more chance to remain stable, but plays havoc for little gains at the price of extra energy lost as heat; thermal sensors can start to kick in even if the auto-option is safe. With the Gaming 5, both automatic overclocking and a manual overclocking is available.", "Our standard overclocking methodology is as follows. We select the automatic overclock options and test for stability with POV-Ray and OCCT to simulate high-end workloads. These stability tests aim to catch any immediate causes for memory or CPU errors.", "For manual overclocks, based on the information gathered from previous testing, starts off at a nominal voltage and CPU multiplier, and the multiplier is increased until the stability tests are failed. The CPU voltage is increased gradually until the stability tests are passed, and the process repeated until the motherboard reduces the multiplier automatically (due to safety protocol) or the CPU temperature reaches a stupidly high level (100ºC+). Our test bed is not in a case, which should push overclocks higher with fresher (cooler) air.", "Referencing back to the Biostar X370GTN review, our Ryzen 7 1700 CPU does have a limitation between 3.9GHz and 4.0GHz; at least on the boards we have tested thus far. This is down to silicon lottery and a combination of a sharp ramp of voltage to temperature when moving up each different step; therefore, cutting out/throttling due to thermal limitations when pushed too far on ambient cooling.", "The Ryzen 7 1700 processor we are using has a 3.0 GHz base core clock speed and a 3.7 GHz turbo, and is rated at 65W.

The Z270 ones have four extra PCIe lanes configurable on the chipset, potentially new audio and new networking controllers, and Intel Optane Technology Support. Although four extra PCIe lanes do sound like a huge difference, it is an important upgrade for the implementation of native M.2 slots (on Z170-based motherboards, this usually meant disabling some other device/port on the motherboard). Also, note that Intel Optane drives should still function on other chipsets as drives; the Z270 only allows them to enable their “smart caching” technology.", "Individual motherboard manufacturers will be sprinkling on new features onto their Z270 products to aid the transition and provide other tangible benefits over the old platform.

With the company intending to market it towards gamers and overclockers rather than HTPC/casual users, the designers of the Z270H4-I try to implement features that gamers could use but, in order to keep the manufacturing cost low, skipped features that they thought gamers do not have a use for.", "A quick glance reveals the presence of dual Gigabit LAN, something that we do not expect to find on cost-effective designs, for example, both of the Gigabit controllers are high-performance chipsets but from different manufacturers (Realtek 8118AS + Intel I-219V). The HD audio CODEC also comes from Realtek and is the popular ALC1150. It has four SATA 6Gb/s connectors, which are adequate for a Mini ITX motherboard. There are also two M.2 slots but only the one at the rear of the motherboard can support SSD drives. The M.2 slot at the front of the motherboard is for a WiFi/Bluetooth M.2 card, which is not included in this motherboard’s bundle. There are many USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports and headers, yet not a single USB 3.1 10 Gb/s Type-C or Type-A port, which is a cost cutting measure, unfortunately for anyone with a modern high-speed mobile or storage device.", "As ECS is trying to promote the Z270H4-I towards gamers, and its marketing focuses most of their effort on the motherboard’s reliability and overclocking capability. On its default settings, the Z270H4-I does perform just as well (or even slightly better) than any of the Z270-based ATX gaming motherboards that we reviewed recently, yet that is because of the BIOS settings that allow the Z270H4-I to persistently run the CPU at its maximum turbo frequency. Other than that, the overclocking capabilities of the Z270H4-I left us indifferent - it has a very broad range of overclocking options but the actual capabilities of the motherboard are highly limited by its power circuitry and thermal design.", "Even though ECS’s marketing is strongly focused on the overclocking capabilities of the ECS Z270H4-I Durathon 2, our overclocking experience was mediocre at best. The BIOS settings are more than adequate and the range of most options is very broad. Some of the voltage settings even are ridiculously broad, such as, for example, the motherboard allowing the CPU core voltage to go up to 2.5 volts.", "A quick glance during our very first visit into the BIOS revealed that the Z270H4-I has, like most motherboards nowadays, the multi-core turbo option pre-enabled, boosting the turbo performance of the CPU up to 4.5 GHz for the first core and 4.4 GHz for the other three cores. This option is by default enabled on the vast majority of modern motherboards, allowing the system to temporarily push the CPUs slightly above their regular ratio. What is very peculiar however is that, by default, the BIOS is set to override the CPU power and ratio limits. Our preliminary testing revealed that, without manually tweaking any BIOS settings, the Z270H4-I was persistently pushing our 7700K up to 4.4 GHz with either single-thread or multi-thread loads.", "Our standard overclocking methodology is as follows. We select the automatic overclock options and test for stability with PovRay and OCCT to simulate high-end workloads. These stability tests aim to catch any immediate causes for memory or CPU errors.", "For manual overclocks, based on the information gathered from previous testing, starts off at a nominal voltage and CPU multiplier, and the multiplier is increased until the stability tests are failed. The CPU voltage is increased gradually until the stability tests are passed, and the process repeated until the motherboard reduces the multiplier automatically (due to safety protocol) or the CPU temperature reaches a stupidly high level (100ºC+). Our test bed is not in a case, which should push overclocks higher with fresher (cooler) air.", "Unlike other motherboards, the Z270H4-I does not have any “automatic” CPU overclocking settings that automatically tweak the CPU’s voltage and ratio to predefined values. Any overclocking needs to be performed manually. However, no matter the voltage and power limit settings, we soon found out that the Z270H4-I simply would not drive our 7700K above 4.5 GHz. As seen in the following picture, even though the CPU ratio was set at ×49, all power limits were disabled and there were no thermal issues, the motherboard is maintaining a CPU frequency of 4.5 GHz under full load. We are unsure if that is due to a BIOS bug that needs to be resolved or, most likely, due to the physical limitations of the motherboard’s power circuitry. We also had no luck with BCLK/FSB overclocking, as the Z270H4-I was entirely unstable with the frequency set at anything higher than 104 MHz."]},

Items such as the all DigiPower VRM design with Dr. MOS MOSFETs, a Hi-Density power 8-pin EPS connector, 15µ gold contacts, 8-layer 2oz copper PCB and the heat pipe configuration for the large VRM heatsinks, are all part of that feature package. ASRock says this heat sink configuration can supports up to 450W from the VRMs with proper airflow. The same 13 phase VRM found on the X299 Taichi and the Gaming i9 makes its way to the OC Formula as well. ", "Other overclocking features include an LN2 mode switch (disables CPU thermal protection, enables additional OC features), Rapid OC buttons to manually adjust the CPU ratio, the BCLK frequency, or the CPU voltages directly on the board. There are also PCIe on/off switches to disable PCIe slots, and the retry/reset/BFG button set for quick access to different types of restarts and boots. These features are found in the upper right-hand corner of the board above the ATX power. For those not wanting to manually overclock and play, the UEFI also has several of Nick's preset overclocking profiles. These range from 4 GHz all the way to extreme overclocking (liquid nitrogen, LN2) profiles. If BCLK adjustment is needed, the X299 OCF also comes with an additional external base clock generator, the Hyper BCLK Engine III. It is designed to support PCIe frequency overclocking and a wider range of BCLK frequency adjustments. ", "Outside of overclocking centered features, the board supports 4-Way SLI and Crossfire in its five full-length PCIe slots, has dual PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots supporting both PCIe and SATA based M.2 modules, eight SATA ports, dual Intel Gigabit LAN ports, and uses the latest Realtek ALC1220 audio codec with ASRock’s Purity Sound 4 software.

The slight change in MSI’s lineup over the last few years, from their trio of Gaming, MPower and XPower lines, to this, has been subtle - most noticeable due to the lack of an MPower if I’m brutally honest. But there is one ribbon that now runs throughout MSI’s veins, whether it is in motherboards, laptops, GPUs, or anything else: the need to have Gaming in the title. Because it cranks in MSI’s newer gaming focus, and it works wonders for SEO.", "The MSI X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC was actually our first X299 motherboard in-house for the Skylake-X launch. We had an early ES sample using some unfinished styling that did the business for our review, but MSI sent us a retail version for a full analysis. This includes the removable plates on the heatsinks that MSI states can be replaced to aid in the aesthetic customisation of a system.", "The big element to X299 over X99 is going to be in the additional features enabled by the chipset: by moving to 20+ PCIe 3.0 lanes available through the chipset, it means elements of modern high-end systems such as storage and networking can be enabled without sacrificing connectivity of the processor. For the X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC, this means dual PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots for storage, a U.2 slot also for storage, and enabling WiFi and USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) with a redriver for Type-C.", "If there’s one metric that MSI has been pushing the last couple of years, it is the motherboard aesthetic. This means consistent, styled angled lines throughout the design using complementary angles for heatsinks and accents. The ‘Carbon’ part of the name refers to the carbon fiber styling on the heatsinks, but also because MSI wanted to give these models a fairly neutral color scheme of black and silver that can be accentuated through the use of RGB lighting. MSI works the neutral color scheme into some of its features: the PCIe and DRAM reinforcement is silver, and the M.2 shields to assist in thermal dissipation are black with angled lines.", "As one of our first X299 motherboards in for review, we do not have much to compare it against. In our CPU testing, the MSI board implemented an enhanced turbo mode by default, giving the CPU extra performance than one might expect.

After carefully scrutinizing the specifications list of both models, the only difference that we could find – chipset aside – is that the A320-based model is limited to memory speeds of DDR4-2666, while the B350 model supports up to DDR4-3200. These models only have two DDR4 memory slots each, so they are limited to 32GB of system memory.", "Both motherboards support AMD's latest Ryzen processors (up to 95W TDP) and the upcoming 7th Generation A-Series APUs, which should be no problem for the 7-phase power design. Given their specialized purpose, these motherboards only have four SATA 6Gb/s ports and no M.2 slots. USB connectivity is quite decent with six USB 3.1 Gen1 ports (four rear, one header) and six USB 2.0 ports (four rear, one header). Two of the USB 2.0 ports are high amperage capable, so they can handle water pumps and/or fans that require up to 1.5 amps. Networking duties are handled by one gigabit LAN port that is powered by a Realtek RTL8111H controller. In terms of rear I/O connectivity, aside from the aforementioned ports, there are two legacy PS/2 connectors, a single DVI-D video output, and three audio jacks courtesy of a low-end Realtek ALC887 codec.", "The key selling point of these two models is obviously their six PCIe slots. They each have one PCIe 3.0 x16 slot, two PCIe 3.0 x1 slots, and three PCIe 2.0 x1 slots. The PCIe x16 slot will operate at x8 if an APU is installed, due to AM4 APU limitations. Now you may be asking how PCIe x1 slots are useful when it comes to handling multiple graphics cards, and the answer is that miners use PCIe 1x to x16 riser cards with flexible extender cables (not included) and special cases that hold the graphics cards well above the motherboard. Crucially, there are also two 4-pin Molex power connectors intended to bolster power delivery to the PCIe slots, and they must be used when mining due to the increased power demands.", "While full-size ATX motherboards generally measure 305mm × 244mm, these two models are both slightly shorter and narrower than the ATX standard at 295mm x 210mm. That may cause issues with certain cases, but BIOSTAR is likely betting on the fact that those who purchase these motherboards will be installing them on purpose-built open test benches.", "We have no information with regard to pricing or availability, but both models will have a 3-year warranty in applicable regions. We expect the pricing to be quite low, given the margins that miners typically work with.

Aside from one less MOSFET heatsink, the chipset, and some different VRM components, all three of these motherboards are all largely indistinguishable. Having said that, whereas the higher-end Z270-based model supports both CPU and memory overclocking, these two new more affordable models are aimed at those running stock-clocked CPUs. As such, they are also limited to memory speeds of DDR4-2400. While we are on the subject of memory, both motherboards clearly only have two memory slots and therefore system memory is limited to 32GB.", "An interesting part of these mini-ITX models is that ASUS have managed to fit two M.2 connectors on a tiny PCB footprint. This is due to a double-decker heatsink design that allows an M.2 drive to be sandwiched between a top cover heatsink and a lower level PCH heatsink. The secondary M.2 connector is located on the back of the motherboard. Both M.2 connectors can handle full-speed PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSDs, as well as Intel Optane Memory, but only one of them supports SATA-based M.2 solid state drives.", "Both motherboards have four SATA 6Gb/s ports and support Intel Rapid Storage Technology, although only the Strix H270I has RAID 0, 1, 5, 10 and Intel SRT capabilities. There is a small divergence when it comes to USB connectivity, with the H270I supporting eight USB 3.0 ports (six rear, one header) and the B250I supporting six USB 3.0 ports (four rear, one header) and two USB 2.0 ports (two rear).", "The H270-based model also has two gigabit LAN ports (one powered by an Intel I219V and the other a Realtek RTL8111H) while the B250-based model only has a single gigabit LAN port courtesy of an Intel I219V controller. All of these LAN ports are protected by LANGuard surge protectors and can be managed using the ASUS GameFirst IV traffic management software.

However, certain elements can be deduced just by looking at the motherboard itself. First and foremost, given its unusually large width, this is clearly an Extended ATX form factor model. This is most evident if you look at the amount of PCB space between the DDR4 memory slots and the edge of the motherboard. In that top-right corner you will also notice a debug LED, power and reset buttons, and the familiar MSI Game Boost Knob.", "The Z270 GODLIKE appears to have good storage connectivity, with one U.2 port, six SATA 6Gb/s ports, one USB 3.1 Gen2 header, two USB 3.0 headers, and three USB 2.0 headers. The triple M.2 slots with M.2 Shields are obviously one of the defining features of this new model. There are four steel-reinforced mechanical PCIe x16 slots, as well as a single PCIe x1 slot. The onboard audio duties are handled by the new AUDIO BOOST 4 XTREME implementation, which features fully isolated audio circuitry, an ESS DAC, and two audio CODECs that will allow gamers the option of using headphones and speakers at the same time.", "As you would expect on a gaming motherboard released in 2017, MSI's Mystic Light RGB LED lightning feature has clearly found its way to the Z270 GODLIKE GAMING. There are fifteen RGB LEDs spread throughout the motherboard, all of which can be independently controlled, along with a 4-pin header that can power an LED light strip. Thanks to the Mystic Light Sync integration, the included Phanteks Rainbow Strip can be made to match the colors and effects of the onboard RGB LEDs. This same sync concept applies to any future Mystic Light Sync compatible products.", "One interesting development is that the Z270 GODLIKE Gaming is going to be first motherboard to utilize the brand new ASMedia ASM3142 USB 3.1 Gen2 host controller. While we don't know much about the new controller, it is the clear successor to the ASM2142, which was the first USB 3.1 Gen2 controller connected with two PCIe 3.0 lanes and thus capable of handling up to 16Gb/s. ASMedia claims that the new ASM3142 controller will not only improve performance, but consume at least 50% less power than previous USB controllers. The performance claims are interesting, since the ASM2142 already had a pretty solid performance advantage over the Intel Alpine Ridge controllers. ", "Another industry first - and apparently an exclusive feature - is the inclusion of Rivet's new Killer xTend technology. By combining the network capabilities of three Killer E2500 LAN controllers and an onboard Killer Wireless-AC 1535 WiFi module, Killer xTend essentially turns the motherboard into both a network switch and a Wi-Fi extender. How these network expansion capabilities work for a wired setup is that one of the three ethernet ports act as a WAN port - in other words the internet input - while the other two act as conventional LAN ports to which you can connect other PCs or even gaming consoles. The Wi-Fi module can be used to wirelessly connect the primary gaming PC to the internet, or as a 867Mbps wireless link to the other PCs/connected devices when using a wired internet connection, or it can even handle both wireless connections when acting as a Wi-Fi range extender. This removes the need to purchase additional networking hardware, simplifies configuration, and of course prioritizes traffic to the Killer-powered gaming PC over that of other connected devices.", "We have no word with regard to pricing or availability, but we definitely expect additional information at Computex 2017."]},

In order to propagate the Killer networking infrastructure moving forward, Rivet is working with their motherboard partners to offer Killer-based software solutions on top of these new multi-gigabit controllers. To start this is a fully software-enabled enterprise tightly coupled to the motherboard vendors and certain multi-gigabit chipsets, but we were told to expect hardware solutions from Killer in the future (time-scale is TBD).", "We discussed with Rivet Networks about the software solutions, which will allow users to prioritize traffic and take advantage of lower ping/fewer freezes when the network is being saturated from the same machines, compared to the current hardware solutions available. When using their own silicon and controller, Rivet stated that they are able to do more, offload more, and implement more features without impacting system performance. The software solution does a number of similar things, but it’s not complete. That being said, the venture into supporting certain multi-gigabit chipsets such as the Aquantia ones is a step forward into preparing for their own silicon. It should be noted that the collaboration is more at the motherboard manufacturer level rather than the silicon level, so Rivet has had to peel through documents and test the supported chipsets to see what features they can offer.", "In discussions with Aquantia, we are expecting to see more vendors offer the AQtion solutions over the coming months, especially with the launch of several high-end desktop platforms in the mix, and these multi-gigabit solutions should be functionality plus points for some premium models.

{"title": "Intel Announces Basin Falls: The New High-End Desktop Platform and X299 Chipset", "paragraph": ["Discussion about the High-End Desktop (HEDT) space this year has been unparalleled. When an age-old competitor re-entered the field, it provided new life into a somewhat dormant platform: how to bring high-performance computing and experiences to the premium segment of the market that was not interested in the business aspect of the ‘professional’ side. Over the last several years in this space, we have seen Intel launch Sandy Bridge-E, Ivy Bridge-E, Haswell-E and Broadwell-E. Today marks the announcement for the next set of processors, named ", " and ", ". But like the platforms before, built on X79 and X99 chipsets, these two new processor families will be covered by the new X299 chipset, code-named Basin Falls.", "Normally we expect to see each generation of Intel’s HEDT platform be a generation behind the mainstream parts: Sandy Bridge-E was launched when Ivy Bridge was mainstream, Broadwell-E was launched when Skylake was mainstream and so on. There was always a delay in cadence, given that these HEDT CPUs, which are derived from the enterprise CPUs, required more time to qualify but also as a market segmentation strategy. For today’s launch of Basin Falls, this strategy changes.", "With X299, Intel is launching HEDT processors based on Skylake, called the Skylake-X family, and processors based on Kaby Lake, called the Kaby Lake-X family. This is a name change from the ‘Broadwell-E’ family which used an E, and now we assume the X stands for Xtreme. All the processors in this family will have an X in them, and the bottom model starts as a six-core processor, putting it above the quad-core parts found in the mainstream platforms. Skylake-X, as we understand it, was initially set to have up to 12 core components, harvesting the smaller silicon used in the enterprise Xeon family. Part of today’s announcement is that Intel will also bring the middle-sized enterprise silicon to consumers, with Skylake-X parts being offered up to 18 cores. This is a break in what we traditionally get on the HEDT platform. Kaby Lake-X will re-use Kaby Lake-S silicon, but with the integrated graphics disabled and better design specifications to push the frequency higher over the mainstream versions.", "This news piece centers around X299 however: the chipset and the motherboards that will bear this chipset. X299 is a marked change from previous X-series chipsets, thanks to the Z-series chipsets on the mainstream processor line. For a couple of generations, the Z-series chipsets have adopted the HSIO (High-Speed IO) topology, essentially allowing the chipset to act like a big PCIe switch. Using the DMI 3.0 link from the processor, which by any other name is essentially a PCIe 3.0 x4 link, the chipset can support 20-24 lanes of PCIe 3.0 from it in various combinations.  With access to 20-24 PCIe lanes from the chipset, rather than having to bother the CPU for PCIe lanes and reduce potential graphics performance, motherboard manufacturers were able to go overboard with additional functionality. This has included more SATA ports, more networking ports, higher performance networking ports such as 10G, extra storage ports, elements such as PCIe storage in an M.2 form factor, or add special unique features specific to that motherboard manufacturer’s package. While there is technically an uplink bottleneck, that is rarely hit unless a user decides to play with multiple high-speed PCIe 3.0 x4 storage devices. What X299 brings to the table for HEDT is this HSIO concept, mirroring the consumer chipset platform.", "New controllers, such as ", " multi-gigabit ethernet chips as well as PCIe storage are now available on the high-end desktop platform for motherboards that implement them. In order to get the same level of coverage, motherboard manufacturers used to have to use a PEX PLX switch – since being bought by Avago, these switches are now 3x the cost, and they introduced a small amount of latency for offering more functionality. The new chipset design hopefully negates those issues.", "", "The DMI link also changes, moving from DMI 2.0 speeds in X79/X99 to DMI 3.0 speeds in X299 to mirror the consumer platforms. As mentioned above, this is practically the same as a PCIe 3.0 x4 link, but at least the HEDT platforms now get to play with higher bandwidth.", "X299 is also going to promote Optane support with the 16GB/32GB Optane drives that are currently on the market available for Intel RST caching modes, as with the Z270 platform. This is somewhat of a non-story, given that X299 is high end: we would expect anyone looking into the Basin Falls ecosystem to already be considering an SSD as an operating system drive to begin with. Optane support only really helps with systems that still want rotating rust (a mechanical HDD) as a main drive. There is support for Optane PCIe SSDs as well, but in essence these are just PCIe drives which would be supported anyway. Intel has not commented on Optane DRAM support, but this is unlikely, given it has not even been announced for enterprise platforms (and reports suggest it is further away than we initially thought).", "So unlike the consumer platforms, we only have one chipset to worry about with HEDT (as is normal). X299 will support natively up to eight SATA 3.0 ports, and up to 10 USB 3.0 ports. We expect there to be some mixing and matching here, but we are waiting for information from Intel, along with the TDP. Intel hasn’t stated which of the SATA ports support RST/RAID, however also to gain parity with the consumer platform, X299 will support RAID with up to three PCIe 3.0 x4 devices. However in order to get the maximum peak bandwidth, motherboard manufacturers will have to derive all the ports from the CPU, not the chipset. Which brings us on to the biggest quirks with Basin Falls.", "As part of the announcement today, Intel is announcing three sets of processors if we band them together by PCIe lane count. The Kaby Lake-X quad core CPUs will feature 16 PCIe lanes, whereas the Skylake-X family will split between 28 PCIe lanes for the low-end processors and 44 PCIe lanes for the high-end processors.", "One of the requirements for X299 is that every SKL-X and KBL-X processor ", " work in all X299 motherboards.", "diagram,", "In order to explain this, here’s an example.", "Say a motherboard manufacturer is designing a mid-to-high end motherboard. They have three PCIe slots from the CPU for graphics, supporting x16/x16/x8 (or x16/x16, x16/x8/x8 or x8/x8/-). The board also supports a CPU based 10G network controller (4 lanes), but also in order to get the best storage performance, they also have two PCIe 3.0 x4 storage slots based on M.2.", "The minute you try and put high-end configurations onto a system, without careful planning (and the expense of routing the signals and muxing/switching the pathways), if a user puts a cheaper processor in place they might lose access to all the extra functionality they paid for.", "", "The other element is the memory configuration issues. The Kaby Lake-X processors will support dual-channel memory, whereas the Skylake-X processors support quad-channel memory. This means that motherboard vendors will have one of three configurations:", "Not only do you have to make sure the board supports your configuration, but for the four-slot designs, if a user chooses the middle option, four slots for four channels at 1DPC, any Kaby Lake-X processor will only be able to use two slots. For the eight DRAM slot design, Kaby Lake-X processor users will have to ensure that if they have two of four memory modules that they are in the right slots, and the motherboard manufacturers have to ensure that the users can easily determine which ones are in use otherwise they might see the memory but not have the performance, or vice versa.", "This is arguably a big mess. In order to compensate, boards might not implement the high-end configurations, meaning that a top of the line processor might not use all the features it comes with.", "What we will likely end up seeing is a split strategy from the motherboard manufacturers. We will see motherboards targeted at either Skylake-X or Kaby Lake-X. All CPUs will work in all boards, but if you pair a SKL-X CPU with a KBL-X focused motherboard, the user may not be able to take advantage of all the features of the CPU they paid for. Vice versa, putting a KBL-X processor in a SKL-X focused board, a number of features that the motherboard has will be unavailable to you.", "One of my requests for the motherboard manufacturers as I have met them over the last few visits is that they need to explain how the motherboards are configured in excruciating detail. This means block diagrams, and not just one diagram: have separate diagrams of what is available if a user decides to implement a 16, 28, or 44 lane processor in play. All that being said, I can see annoyance on the horizon if users do not do the research. While adding support for quad-core KBL-X processors on the HEDT platform is an interesting move, it’s not one I would have suggested without bringing parity on the PCIe lane count (although that would require new silicon dies, and perhaps would not be worth the cost of designing them).", "Perhaps a final note about X299 based motherboards. All will support overclocking on the CPU and DRAM, with multiplier and base clock frequency adjustments expected. Typically with a new launch, the motherboard manufacturers will run internal overclocking events using any manner of sub-zero coolants in order to launch with as many overclocking world records as possible. We are told to expect records to be broken with both KBL-X and SKL-X, though it will be interesting to see how that translates into 24/7 overclocks."]},

Nominally the Killer software offers six levels of priority, with the default being priority 4. All mass download / update systems get the lowest priority (six), while VOIP sits at the top, followed by gaming. With this xTend feature, all traffic going from other devices through the main PC will be classified as priority 4, although this may change (offering per-device configuration) in future software revisions.", "Killer xTend was accidentally (?) announced with the launch of MSI’s new Z270 Godlike Gaming motherboard, which uses three E2500 network ports and the Killer 1535 Wi-Fi module.

There are both 8-pin and 4-pin CPU/EPS power connectors, which should come in handy if a high TDP 18-core Skylake-X processor is installed. There are Japanese 10K capacitors used throughout the motherboard, not counting the Nichicon audio-grade capacitors used in the onboard audio section. The eight Q-DIMM memory slots are clipless on one side, and they can handle up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. No word yet on what the highest supported overclocked memory speed is for this model.", "While this motherboards has four mechanical PCIe x16 slots, only the two grey ones are actually x16 capable. The middle slot is limited to x4 and the bottom slot is limited to x8. This means that the X299-Deluxe will 'only' be able to handle three-way graphics configurations. Three of the four PCIe x16 slots have been given the SafeSlot treatment, which is to say that they have been mechanically reinforced with steel and additional anchor points for superior retention and shearing resistance. There are also two PCIe x1 slots.", "Storage connectivity appears quite good with six SATA 6Gb/s ports, one U.2 port, and two M.2 slots that support SATA, PCI-E, and PCI-E NVMe M.2 solid state drives. Intel's new Optane Memory technology is also supported. One of the M.2 slots is under the large chipset heatsink and the other is next to the right bank of memory slots, and has been designed to hold M.2 drives vertically. In addition, the motherboard supports six USB 2.0 ports (four rear, one header), eight USB 3.0 ports (four rear, two headers), and six USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (four rear, one header). Focusing on the full-speed USB 3.1 Gen2 ports, there are three Type-A ports and one Type-C port on the rear I/O panel, and a USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel internal header next to the memory slots. If that wasn't enough, ASUS are also including their ThunderboltEX 3 add-on card, which means Thunderbolt 3 capabilities, 40Gbps transfer speeds, and 36W of power delivery to external peripherals. When it comes to networking, there are two gigabit LAN ports powered by some variant of Intel controller, and an onboard dual-band Wi-Fi solution that supports the new 802.11ad protocol and is capable of theoretical tranfer rates up to 4.6Gbps.", "The onboard audio duties are handled by a new Crystal Sound implementation, which features a Realtek S1220A codec paired to an amplifier, Nichicon audio-grade capacitors, and a PCB-level audio isolation line. If you want a motherboard that looks even better than it sounds, the highly customizable Aura Sync RGB LED lighting feature is well-represented on this model. There are unique-looking and independently controllable light bars integrated into the rear I/O shield and the chipset heatsinks, there is a 4-pin header that can power RGB LED light strips, and thanks to Aura Sync you can synchronize the colors and effects of compatible products to match that of your motherboard.", "While we are on the topic of aesthetics, one of the more unusual new features is the OLED screen has been integrated into the chipset heatsink.

However, it will have the same 8-phase digatal CPU power design, it will also support up to three-way graphics configurations, it will have two M.2 slots, and have similar if not identical storage and USB connectivity. The onboard audio solution should be identical as well.", "When it comes to differences, we expect this model to only have one gigabit LAN port, and to also not feature any onboard Wi-Fi solution. It should have a more simplistic chipset heatsink and be missing at least one of the two integrated light bars. However, it will have two RGB LED light strip headers instead of the one on the Prime X299-Deluxe. Needless to say that we don't expect the ThunderboltEX 3 add-on card or the Fan Extension card in this model's accessories bundle.", "Moving on to the ", ", these models prioritize reliability and durability thanks to tougher components and more stringent testing.

Not only does the cover prevent dust from accumulating on the board, but it helps direct the integrated fan's airflow to the proper areas, like towards the primary M.2 slots. Speaking of fans, there are four fan headers near the CPU socket and six other spread throughout the motherboard. In order to manage thermals you need to be able to monitor temperatures, and this model takes care about with a number of onboard temperature sensors that monitor seperate zones on the motherboard and then feed that data into the Thermal Radar 3 utility. The TUF Detective mobile app returns, but this serving as a wireless means of diagnosing and monitoring the system via a smartphone.", "Although not visible, the Mark 1 features a Fortifier backplate, which ASUS claim is their strongest one yet. This metal plate serves to stiffen the motherboard against warping, but it helps dissipate heat from various thermal hotspots that can appear on the back of the PCB. ASUS has also included a removable GPU Holder that can support the weight of a graphics cards, and prevent strain on the PCIe slots.", "When it comes to basic specs, this model shouldn't disappoint. It features same the 8-phase digital CPU power design and 10K Japanese capacitors as the two Prime series model. It has eight SATA 6Gb/s port and two M.2 slots. There is one USB 3.1 Gen2 header, two USB 3.0 headers, and one USB 2.0 header.

Both of those PCIe x16 slots are steel-reinforced SafeSlots, which should protect them from the shearing effects of heavy graphics cards. The third PCIe x16 slot is limited to x8, which means that this model can still handle up to three-way SLI or CrossFire. There are two open-ended PCIe x4 slots which can physically support expansions cards with up x16 connectors. There is also one PCIe slot that is not visible to us since it is hidden under armor cover, but which is likely a PCIe x1 slot.", "There is RGB LED lighting integrated into the logo at the center of the board, and it will glow different colors based on the system load. If that is not enough lighting for you, there is also what appears to be a RGB LED light strip header at the very bottom of the motherboard. Rounding out the ", " features list is an onboard power button, a MemOK! button, and diagnostics LEDs.", "The more affordable ", " strips down some of the Mark 1's unique features to create a more conventional motherboard. Much like the Prime X299-A is to the Prime X299-Deluxe, this model delivers much of the same functionality, but at a more affordable price. ASUS has done this by removing the protective armor and the backplate. It also loses two SATA 6GB/s ports - down to six total - and one of the PCIe x4 slots has been swapped for a PCIe x1 slot. There is also no USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel header on this model, and the total fan header count has been reduced from ten down to seven. On the plus side, the TUF X299 Mark 2 appears to have greater onboard RGB LED lighting, with LEDs mounted under much of the right side of the motherboard.

By contrast, the new unit has four SO-DIMM DDR4 memory slots and even supports DDR4 overclocking (assuming that there are SO-DIMMs that can be significantly overclocked). In fact, putting four memory slots onto a small motherboard while also fitting the LGA 2066 socket and required high-capactiy VRMs is a rather remarkable engineering achievement. The flip side however is that the very tightly packed design of the X299E-ITX/ac may impose certain limitations on compatibility with large cooling systems.", "Just like every other Mini-ITX motherboard around, the ASRock X299E-ITX/ac has only one PCIe 3.0 x16 slot for graphics cards. In the meantime, the X299E-ITX/ac is the first miniature mainboard to feature three M.2 slots (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) for SSDs. In addition, the board carries six SATA 6 Gbps headers for builds that require multiple storage devices in drive form-factor. It is noteworthy that in order to fit everything it wanted onto a Mini-ITX PCB, ASRock had to place the USB 3.1 controller, SATA ports and one M.2 slot on custom DIMM-like modules - essentially going vertical when they ran out of horizontal space. Such modules add certain dimension-related limitations to the size of CPU radiators (plus, it remains to be seen how higher-end M.2 SSDs perform when located near a CPU cooler), but this is a tradeoff that the manufacturer had to take.", "As for connectivity, the X299E-ITX/ac comes with a 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 module (based on an Intel controller), two GbE ports (Intel controllers too), two USB 3.1 headers  (Type-A and Type-C), six USB 3.0 connectors, 7.1-channel audio sub-system (enabled by the Realtek ALC1220 controller) and so on.", "The ASRock X299E-ITC/ac will be available in the coming months for about $280 - $300, depending on the region and other factors.

Roman states that only two of the dies are enabled, which simplifies things, but there are a few caveats here to note.", "First, this was a Threadripper ES and the retail chips could be quite different. Roman deliberately covered up the markings on the processor on the video (although some images got out), and it was unclear what stage ES this was – as AMD could very likely just give half-disabled EPYCs with different notches in the first ES batches. Simply put, retail Threadripper chips could only have two.", "There are several reasons why there could be four though. One suggestion is that these are ‘failed’ EPYCs, although AMD would say that is not the case. If AMD were putting four die onto a chip and disabling two, that would be really bad for the price on return per die, so what is going on here? Simply put, the two ‘disabled’ die aren’t engineered silicon at all, just simple silicon that hasn’t been put through the manufacturing process and added in as spacers for package rigidity. With the Threadripper package being so large, having four places for the mass of the coolers to press onto in the socket for better contact with the socket pins, using spacers would help spread that weight around. There have been suggestions it might help with heat dissipation, but that is unlikely as any heat transfer would be through the TIM and the HS, not through the package itself which is fairly thermally insulating.", "To sum up:", "If this is even indicative of a Threadripper retail sample (again, no confirmation it is), our guess is that these two extra ‘dies’ is just empty silicon used for rigidity. So anyone claiming to get 32 cores through unlocking software is not telling the truth. But consider that it should allow AMD to push 32 cores with a quad-channel memory design into the TR4 socket if they wanted in the future. That depends on how long this platform is expected to be around, likely through to Zen 2 at a minimum and perhaps Zen 3 as well. I’ll go ask AMD."]},

From this, Intel released a new stepping of the CPU to address the bug, and some have predicted that the delays to the formal announcement and release of the Denverton stack (some 12 months or more after the expected announcement date) is due to ensuring Denverton does not have this issue.", "As for the C3958, GIGABYTE Server lists this as Intel’s top Denverton SoC model, running at 16 cores, 1MB of L2 per core, 2.0 GHz base frequency (no word on turbo), support for up to 128GB of DDR4-2400 RDIMMs (or 64GB of UDIMMs, i.e. 4x16GB modules) and having a 31W TDP. Typically around this SoC level, we might expect to compare it to an E3-1200 v6 series processor, although those CPUs start at 72W. The previous generation Rangeley processor topped out at 8 cores and 2.4 GHz for 20W, so on paper there looks to be some efficiency gain despite the frequency decrease.", "As for the MA10-ST0 motherboard, along with all the features above it also comes with 32GB of eMMC flash, allowing a user to install a storage-based OS for a network deployment without using any of the onboard SATA ports.

A board specifically made for overclockers, this is where they put a lot of focus initially in building a robust product and brand, with a set of features directly targeted for a niche set of users. These efforts were supported by ASRock employee a former world #1 overclocker, Nick Shih, to help shape the board design and features.", "ASRock also has the “Extreme” line-up of motherboards, built across AMD and Intel platforms, touting stability and sharing some the common features that the more expensive boards had. The Extreme series ranged from the budget models like the Extreme 3, to high-end workstation like boards in the Extreme 11 that boasted extraordinary onboard storage capabilities. This approach helped develop ASRock's name as one of the 'big four' when it came to motherboards, rather than just the low budget player it was designed to be after spinning out from ASRock. For the gaming side of things, ASRock took out a Fatal1ty licence (a pro-gamer from the early 2000s) and applied it to models based on the Extreme line with additional 'gaming' features to produce a gaming line. This included special controllers, such as a specific high-frequency USB port, allowing users to adjust their preferred mouse polling rate in older operating systems such as Windows XP, or the ubiqitous implementation of Killer Network controllers with bundled prioritization software. The Gaming line is a fully fledged arc in ASRock's ecosystem, as the word 'Gaming' is now a driving force in product discovery.", "In ASRock's X299 line, the pitch starts with the X299 Killer SLI/ac at $230 at the entry level, to their flagship Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 board we have in hand here at nearly $390. Between those two are the Fatal1ty Gaming X299 Gaming K6 ($249), and the X299 Taichi ($289), with varying upgraded features as we move up the stack. For the Gaming i9, this means upgraded ethernet to 10-gigabit provided by Aquantia's AQC107 controller, additional WiFi, support for three PCIe 3.0 x4 storage drives, upgraded audio, an onboard USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) header, support for multiple GPUs, support for Thunderbolt 3, and a multi-generational BIOS/software package. The Gaming i9 aims to be a well-rounded, feature laden option in the higher-end of the motherboard space.", "Performance overall was right around the other motherboards we have tested so far. Depending on which benchmark result is taken it ended up from leading to last, though not by any significant margin either way. It used a bit less power than the MSI board tested and booted a couple of seconds faster, but in many of our CPU short form tests was bringing up the rear of the small pack at default settings, due to some 'overclocking' settings being automatically enabled on the competition by default.

As literally dozens of Z270-based motherboards were released, we could not possibly review them all and we centered our choices on products that we believed to be of interest to the largest portion of our readers.

Despite its typical ATX dimensions, the Z270 Supercarrier is loaded to the hilt, with a tremendous number of connectors and several features that cannot be found on mainstream motherboards. While the price tag will drive every casual/mainstream user away instantly, the Z270 Supercarrier is one of the few choices with a LGA1151 CPU socket available for professional designers and gamers who are not satisfied with one or two GPUs.", "A simple glance at the list of this motherboard’s features is likely to leave most people in awe. If we were to single out the highlights of the Z270 Supercarrier, these would be the 14-phase CPU power circuitry, the four PCIe ×8 slots for full-size graphics cards and the AQUANTIA 5 Gbps network controller, all of which are features that cannot be found on mainstream motherboards. The number of supported storage devices is immense, with three PCIe ×4 M.2 slots, six SATA connectors and two SATA Express connectors. Each SATA connector may also be used as two standard SATA ports, bringing the maximum number of regular SATA devices up to 10 if no SATA Express devices are installed. There are no U.2 connectors and this is one of the very few features that the Z270 Supercarrier is lacking. This problem can be easily tackled with the use of proper M.2 to U.2 adapters.", "The ASRock Z270 Supercarrier also has very interesting controllers installed. The “Purity Sound 4” onboard audio has a popular ALC1220 audio controller supplied by Realtek at its heart, supported by a Texas Instruments NE5532 headset amplifier and other hardware. It has not one, not two, but three different LAN controllers. The first is the Aquantia AQC108 5 Gbps controller, which is one of the highlights of this motherboard. Intel supplies the other two Gigabit controllers (I219V and I211AT), as well as the wireless LAN module (AC3160).

That is a very limited segment of the market and ASRock’s engineers are clearly trying to expand it by adding features that would also tempt gamers and overclockers with very large budgets. Even in its default configuration, the ASRock Z270 Supercarrier manages to outperform every other Z270-based motherboard that we have tested to this date, while it also displayed very promising overclocking capabilities during our testing. At this point we should mention that the higher overall performance does not come from any magic tricks but, as we found out during our testing, by ASRock’s engineers “cheating” and setting the CPU’s Turbo multiplier at 45 by default, allowing a 7700K processor to reach 4.5 GHz without tweaking any BIOS settings or other options.", " ", "(", ") ", "(", ") ", "(", ") ", "(", ") ", "(", ") ", "(", ") ", " ", "", " ", "", " ", "In comparison to the older Z170 boards, the new Z270 board on the base specifications are hardly any different.

Per the Military Class VI specs, it uses Titanium chokes and 'dark' capacitors. We cannot confirm by the pictures, however, it is likely using the same DrMOS ICs found on the Pro Carbon. Power is fed to the VRMs by two 12V CPU leads (one is optional) located in the upper left-hand corner of the board.

The X370GTN joins a very short list of mini-ITX form factor AMD Ryzen compatible motherboards, but it comes in at one of the cheapest.", "To read specifically about the X370/B350 chip/platform and the specifications therein, our deep dive into what it is can be found at ", ".", "With smaller form factor motherboards, the cost is in paying for the privilege of a smaller, more space friendly option. This should be more prevalent in AMD's recent product portfolio, as the size of the socket offers zero favors when it comes to layout: when the socket is large, everything else has to be smaller. Biostar, known for being at the cheaper end of the market, is attempting to combine the smaller form factor with a small price compared to other mini-ITX boards on the market. ", "One very interesting implementation from Biostar is the Realtek RTL8118AS Gigabit controller, which Realtek calls their 'Dragon' network controller in direct competition to the Killer network controllers we see on other boards. The reason why this is interesting, aside from the controller being relatively rare on consumer motherboards, is that (we were told) this is the physically smallest network controller available for consumer use. So there is some thought behind controller choice other than cost! That being said, Biostar uses 5k solid caps rather than the 10k/12k models we see on most other motherboards, which is a clear sign of cost-cutting (despite 5k being supported in the specification manuals).", "The X370GTN has four SATA connectors, which is fairly standard for ITX motherboards; these ports allow the use of RAID 0, 1 and 10 arrays. In addition to the SATA ports, Biostar has included a single PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 port on the rear of the PCB which allows for use with SATA and PCIe use. USB is aplenty, and there are also additional USB headers for front panel connectors. ", "Biostar has advertised that the Biostar X370GTN is designed with gamers in mind, placing inside its 'Racing' line of motherboards. For such a low-cost option, especially in a mini-ITX form factor, it will be an interesting scenario to see if the board can perform.", "In the west, Biostar is not as prevalent as certain other motherboard vendors in overclocking. However, based on personal testing their recent offerings, they have been showing great promise with each iteration. The idea of hammering out lots of MHz on an ITX board doesn’t exactly sound plausible, but being on the X370 chipset, users may expect at least some element of headroom to play with. It should be noted that the Biostar X370GTN only allows overclocking through the BIOS when it has been updated to at least AGESA 1006 BIOS.", "The Biostar BIOS is relatively basic, which has upsides and downsides. The X370GTN is as simple to overclock as virtually any other motherboard with a changeable multiplier and basic voltage control, but it lacks some of the finer tuning of other motherboards (especially if a user wants to go for extreme, sub-zero cooling). The overclocking settings are in a screen titled O.N.E. Apparently it keeps all the core overclocking settings in O.N.E easy place.", "A caveat I have with the BIOS is with regards the voltage adjustments for overclocking. The only option for adjustment is via offsets, rather than having set values. This can mean that for users already familiar with the platform, the overclocker can end up second-guessing themselves with respect the voltage that actually needs to be applied. This could potentially cause damage, even with experienced users. One way around this is to use the Ryzen Master overclocking software, which should translate a voltage value into a specific offset for the BIOS, although for experienced users this is not an ideal scenario. ", "Our standard overclocking methodology is as follows. We select the automatic overclock options and test for stability with POV-Ray and OCCT to simulate high-end workloads. These stability tests aim to catch any immediate causes for memory or CPU errors.", "For manual overclocks, based on the information gathered from previous testing, starts off at a nominal voltage and CPU multiplier, and the multiplier is increased until the stability tests are failed. The CPU voltage is increased gradually until the stability tests are passed, and the process repeated until the motherboard reduces the multiplier automatically (due to safety protocol) or the CPU temperature reaches a stupidly high level (100ºC+). Our test bed is not in a case, which should push overclocks higher with fresher (cooler) air.", "heatsinks were already getting ", "The base Ryzen 7 1700 processor we are using has a 3.0 GHz base and a 3.7 GHz turbo, and is rated at 65W. Our stock load power numbers were surprisingly low (more about that later in the review), but when overclocked to 4.0 GHz (during brief periods of stable) the overall power consumption taken at the wall was pushing above 185W."]},

The chipset can support six, but instead of having all six on there and sharing, they went without. I have to expect for the vast majority of users this will not be a concern. Those who require more than four SATA ports will have to do so via expansion cards. ", "The N7 has a total of five PCIe slots with positions 2 and 4 (the full-length slots), connected to the CPU and intended for video cards. Slots 1(x1), 3(x4), and 5(x4) are all connected through the chipset. Back panel connectivity consists of four USB 3.0 ports and five USB 2.0 ports, CMOS Reset button, HDMI/DisplayPort Video outputs, the Intel RJ-45 port and the 6-plug 7.1 channel audio stack. The board does not have any USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) ports. ", "The NZXT has placed an MSRP of $299.99. That price point puts in in direct competition with some solid motherboards. The ASRock Z370 Professional Gaming i7 is priced at ", ", the ROG Maximus X Hero (Wi-Fi AC) sits at ", " with the Gigabyte Z370 AORUS Gaming 7 prices at $250. At the same or lesser price point, the ASRock and ASUS include Wi-Fi and USB 3.1 (10 Gbps). Pretty stiff competition around the $300 mark.", "One important piece of information to note: technically these processors use the LGA1151 socket, also used by 6th and 7th Generation processors using the Z170 and Z270 chipsets. But due to several (albeit minor) difference in the pin-layout of these two sets of processors, the 8th Generation Coffee Lake will only work in Z370 boards and are not cross compatible. ", "When compared to the previous generation, the Core i7-8700K starts at a higher price, but for that price comes more cores and a higher turbo frequency. The Core i7-8700K is a good example of how adding cores works: in order to keep the same power consumption, the overall base frequency has to be lowered to match the presence of extra cores. However, in order to keep the responsiveness higher than the previous generation, the single thread performance is often pushed to a higher multiplier. In almost all situations this counts as a win-win, and makes pushing for the 6-core part, on paper at least, a no-brainer."]},

The purpose of the new chipset, called X470, was for iterative updates: better memory support, lower power consumption, and a couple of other things to be announced closer to launch around April.", "At GIGABYTE’s suite, they had to hand an ‘X470’ Aorus Gaming 7 WiFi, with the chipset name bit taped over. The initial view of the motherboard was that of a standard high-end AM4 motherboard, using M.2 heatsinks, PCIe reinforcement, DRAM slot reinforcement, LEDs between the DRAM slots, the plastic LED section near the 24-pin connector, a few buttons for overclocking, and heatsinks indicative of GIGABYTE’s Aorus brand. With an iterative update, we were not expecting much change.", "The change most obvious out of the few was the heatsink – GIGABYTE is set to go back to a bare-metal many-finned design for the power delivery heatinks. This might not be the most aesthetically pleasing design, however it is one that offers better power delivery cooling than the plastic shrouds we sometimes see on high-end motherboards hiding a small metal mass. GIGABYTE stated that they will be using the latest International Rectifier solution for the power delivery, and are ready for users to crank up the frequency when they want to. To add to the story on power and heatsinks, the rear of the motherboard also has a retention/rigidity plate around the power delivery, which may provide additional support.", "GIGABYTE also has an integrated rear-panel backplate on this X470 design, to save users the embarrassment of having to disassemble the PC having forgotten about it after the fact. On this rear panel there is a power switch, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and the usual sets of USB and Ethernet connections. It is worth noting that there are two USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) ports here, plus one header on the board as well. We were told that these were all native, which would suggest that there is an increase in USB 3.1 support on the X470 chipset.", "In April we will see the launch of AMD’s second generation Ryzen processors based on Zen+ cores and built on GloFo’s 12nm process, and while X470 will be optimized for these parts, the motherboards will still accept first generation Ryzen (and 300-series motherboards will accept second generation with a BIOS update). It would appear that there is no specific NDA/embargo around X470 for the motherboard manufacturers, however, GIGABYTE was the only one to be comfortable showing hardware at CES. When asked, the other manufacturers stated that with the launch several months away, they were not ready to show anything."]},

The main benefit for a motherboard manufacturer to push out one of the smaller form factor motherboards is if they are the only ones (or one of the only ones) with a product in that segment. Thus ASRock is first to market with a micro-ATX motherboard for AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper processors. It is a big socket on a tiny motherboard.", "We reported on ASRock ", ", but we met with ASRock at their suite and got some hands on. If there is one thing easy to spot on this motherboard, it is the socket – it does not leave a lot of room for anything else. Even though ASRock is known for its esoteric designs such as the X299-ITX/ac, ASRock categorically stated that with a socket this big, mini-ITX is impossible without some major compromises such as two DRAM slots.", "For the X399M Taichi, it lives up to the Taichi name and comes well equipped with the basics without going overboard. The motherboard itself is fairly hefty, if only for the socket and heatsink arrangement, but ASRock feel they have had a good swing at the functionality. With 64 PCIe lanes from the processor to play with, it made sense to offer three x16 PCIe slots, even though in most cases only one or two would be used (or perhaps a GPU and two of those quad M.2 cards!) and still leave 16 PCIe lanes left over for other things. This gives a U.2 port, three M.2 slots, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, more USB 3.0 ports, USB 3.1, Purity Sound audio, and plenty of action besides.", "The key differentiation features, aside from the size of the board, come in a number of areas. First, two of the M.2 slots are found on the top right hand side of the board. ASRock felt that users would prefer three M.2 drives in total and only four memory slots rather than one M.2 drive and eight memory slots. Another change is the secondary EPS 8-pin connector, which appears on the top right of the board in an odd location. ASRock felt it necessary on a board like this to also include eight SATA ports, making the X399M Taichi a potential catch all for any storage requirements. Ultimately the only thing missing here is 5GbE or 10GbE Ethernet from Aquantia, but instead ASRock uses dual Intel controllers instead. Not to be left out, there are some RGB LEDs on the board as well.", "ASRock intends to ship the X399M Taichi sometime in Q1, with the price still to be determined."]},
{"title": "Supermicro at CES 2018: The First Supero Mini-ITX Motherboard", "paragraph": ["A few elements to Supermicro’s suite at CES were intriguing, one of which was the company’s first foray into a consumer mini-ITX motherboard. The C7Z370-CG-IW, based on Z370 and Intel’s 8", " Generation Coffee Lake processors, is going up against several motherboard vendors with immense experience in this area, but Supermicro believes that it can add something different to the market.", "Supermicro’s consumer, gaming focused brand is called ‘Supero’/’SuperO’, and the idea is that they are using the expertise from designing so many custom server systems over the years that the experience can translate into the consumer market. Supermicro is a big company, and so the company has put forward a few products for each major chipset the last few years. It has a couple of Z370 products out in the market, and this C7Z370-CG-IW is its first proper attempt at mini-ITX. Of course, the name doesn’t win awards: ‘C7’ is what is put on all the consumer boards, ‘CG’ is for consumer gaming, and ‘IW’ isn’t specified, but likely to mean ‘ITX-something’.", "Normally with motherboards from companies with a server focus, one of the overriding visual feelings is that the boards are sparse with features, given that server boards are often built for specific machines rather than a general PC that could have any number of components. On something as small as a mini-ITX board however, there is little room, and the visual look of this board means it doesn’t stand out of the crowd like some OEM motherboards do.", "The product manager for this board stated that it is using server grade power delivery (with what looks like a 4+2 or 5+1 arrangement), and features like reinforced DRAM and PCIe slots were a must when the board was designed. One thing that struck me is that SM has not fallen into the trap where some of the major consumer motherboard manufacturers did in their early mITX offerings: the 8-pin power is on the edge of the board which is good, the SATA ports are also on the edge, and not tucked in behind the DRAM, and the Wi-Fi chipset does not have cables winding around the board to the rear panel. Overall, this is (on visual inspection), already an interesting offering. To add in the mix, SM also has two M.2 slots: one just above the PCIe that can take advantage of the chipset heatsink, and another slot on the rear of the board.", "The C7Z370-IW-CG is rated to take CPUs up to 120W (which covers the i7-8700K at a high all-core turbo), memory up to DDR4-3733 (which is high for a mini-ITX), and bundles dual video outputs, USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) ports, and Intel Ethernet along with the 802.11ac Wi-Fi card. There’s also the Realtek ALC1220 audio codec, and customizable RGB LEDs on board with an RGB header.", "If there is a criticism on a first look, it is that the front panel header is right by the PCIe latch, and large GPUs will not like the standard paired cables that go with front panel switches. The audio codec front panel header is also awkwardly positioned for any GPU that has a back-plate. Ultimately it looks like mini-ITX focused GPUs would fit in quite well here, though some of the bigger standard GPUs might make things difficult if SM hasn’t bundled in an easier way to connect these cables.", "We were told to expect this motherboard to be on sale shortly."]},
{"title": "Supermicro at CES 2018: X299 Motherboards, for Upcoming 300W CPUs?", "paragraph": ["Aside from the mini-ITX motherboard on display, Supermicro also had its two X299 consumer-based motherboards on display. These two were somewhat identical, although each had a separate key feature – one with IPMI interactivity normally need on server-level motherboards, and the other had an interesting listing on CPU power consumption support.", "The first board, the C9X299-PGF, with integrated IPMI management, has been listed on Supermicro’s website for a while, but we were able to see it up close for the first time. Normally on server motherboards, the Aspeed AST2500 controller that does this management has a dedicated Ethernet interface, but in the consumer line-up, it actually piggybacks off of one of the two built-in gigabit Ethernet ports instead. Some home users enjoy having this functionality, and as such Supermicro offers two versions: one with, and one without.", "The second board, however, is the surprising one. Listed as the C9X299-PG300, where ‘PG’ is for Professional Gaming, it uses Supermicro’s new heatsink design for dual M.2 drive cooling supported by the chipset, with RGB LEDs underneath the chipset heatsink to illuminate the ‘Play Harder’ slogan for the Supero consumer product brand. The rear panel has an updated cover using the same metallic look and colors, as does the power delivery heatsink on the CPU.", "Staying on the CPU for a second: the reason it is called the ‘PG300’ is because this motherboard is geared up to accept CPUs with up to 300W TDP. This comes across as somewhat odd – the X299 platform only has CPUs up to 165W listed. Even with turbo modes applied and all cores going, somewhere around 240-250W is ‘normal’, which would mean that the system is being geared for something bigger.", "Now at this point, I should point out that the Z370 motherboard on display said ‘support’ up to 120W TDP, which might draw the same conclusion, although the CPUs that the Z370 supports have been observed at 120W in regular use with motherboard turbo modes. Also, there was a Xeon W motherboard on display, stating support for CPUs up to 165W TDP, which is what I would have expected. So with this C9X299-PG300, listing 300W TDP support, it can mean one of two things.", "Obviously trying to confirm this on the record is somewhat of a fruitless task. Supermicro couldn’t answer any questions (not even as a negative), and Intel does not comment on rumor/future product.", "Two other things spring to mind on this. A number of X299 motherboards, especially the high-end ones, are built for extreme overclocking, where the CPU can draw 500W+. None of those are listed as having 300W TDP support, although Supermicro is a bit different to those companies. Secondly, the initial run of X299 motherboards had problems with CPUs with high power consumption and the power delivery, causing the VRMs to overheat and throttle. Some vendors combatted this with new designs with bigger heatsinks, so it would be a similar kettle of fish if higher TDP processors were released.", "However, other features on the PG300 include dual U.2 ports, an Aquantia AQC107-based 10-gigabit ethernet port, support for dual M.2 drives, support up to DDR4-4000, and customizable RGB LED headers. There is also legacy PS2 support, and a pair of USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) controllers, giving four ports on the rear."]},
{"title": "Supermicro at CES 2018: X11SRA Xeon W Motherboard on Display", "paragraph": ["Another product on display over at Supermicro at this year’s CES was that of a Xeon W motherboard. Xeon W is Intel’s professional platform that is almost a copy/paste of the high-end desktop X299 platform, but uses a professional grade chipset and offers support for ECC and RDIMM memory. Like Skylake-X, the Xeon W platform supports up to 18-core CPUs (Xeon W-2195), with almost the same specifications, except for support up to 512GB of DRAM. In previous years, these two families of products were served by a single platform, but recently Intel has seen fit to separate them. As a result, we are seeing fewer and fewer professional-grade motherboards hitting the open market, leaving most sales in the hands of pre-built OEMs. With Supermicro being one of those OEMs but with a consumer line, they are planning to offer at least one consumer/professional motherboard for this market, and that is the X11SRA we saw in the booth.", "", "If we look at the X11SRA, we can see a lot of similarities with the consumer X299 motherboards from Supermicro. Features like the dual U.2 ports from the C9X299-PG300 are here, along with reinforced DRAM slots and reinforced PCIe slots. The layout with dual M.2 drives seems to be a copy paste too, and there are a couple of unused pads on the bottom left which would normally be occupied by an Aspeed AST2500 management chip with some memory, as seen on the X299-PGF. With these pads present, there is likely to be an ‘X11SRA-F’ version alongside this board in due course.", "This X11SRA at the booth, we were told, was not a final version. The chipset and power delivery heatsinks still need to be finalized, and it would seem that there is an additional heatsink to the left of the DRAM slots near the rear IO for something (multi-gigabit Ethernet?). Visually, it is plainly obvious that the two sets of DRAM slots are at different heights on the motherboard – this would normally be jarring for a consumer motherboard, but for professional builds, it does not matter too much.", "The CPU power delivery shows only a 5-phase solution, which on a consumer motherboard would be dreadfully low. Xeon W processors are not designed to support overclocking, so Supermicro can make their motherboards to fit just within specifications and warranty. It’s worth noting that the spec list for the board states it supports only up to 165W, which is the 18-core Xeon W-2195, rather than Supermicro’s PG300 board that stated up to 300W.", "Other features on the board includes a Realtek ALC1220 codec, which is a surprisingly high-end choice for a professional motherboard, however it does not feature much in the way of advanced filtering or PCB separation that we see on consumer motherboards. Internet connectivity comes via an Intel I219-LM gigabit Ethernet controller, and Aquantia’s AQC108 5-gigabit network controller. USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) seems to be supported through two Type-A ports on the rear panel.", "As the X11SRA is still a work in progress, the release date is still TBD."]},

SuperO on the other hand (think of it like AORUS is to GIGABYTE) brings to the table whole systems, chassis, and motherboards which they say has server DNA under the surface but gaming features on the outside. SuperO has been a presence in the market since the Z87 chipset hit the scene a few years back. Since that time, they have brought out more motherboards in three different classes - Core Business (designed for high uptime), Core Gaming (focuses on essentials for professionals, gamers seeking a well-round option), and Professional Gaming (flagships of the SuperO line, latest features and performance) and have a seemingly well balanced set of SKUs covering multiple use scenarios. SuperO is hoping the trust they built in the server space continues to translate over to the consumer side as their board certification process is similar to what is used on the server level boards. ", "This leads into explaining the naming: C7Z370-CG-IW is a bit of a mouthful. Breaking it down:", "One of the recommendations we would put to the SuperO team is to have an easier naming system!", "For the Z370 chipset, SuperO currently has two motherboards available, a full sized (ATX) C7Z370-CG-L, and the C7Z370-CG-IW we have for review here. The 200-series platform has a total of eight boards varying from the B250 and H270, up to the Z270 chipsets. I would gather as time goes on we will see more offerings covering their Professional Gaming and Core Business segments. For this review, we will be working with the only Mini-ITX board they have released in the C7Z370-CG-IW. ", "In our performance numbers, it is worth noting that in our shipping BIOS came an odd set of default parameters. The motherboard TDP limit was defaulting to 65W, perhaps because this is what the system engineers think is the suitable limit for a board of this size. No other manufacturer does this - if they have a smaller system that has a peak TDP, then this is listed in CPU support, not forced through default BIOS options. As a result, should any user want a 65W+ CPU in this board, then BIOS adjustments will have to be made.", "The benchmark numbers when the TDP limit was lifted were as expected. Power consumption at idle for a smaller sized motherbroard was lower than the larger systems, however second-tier motherboard manufacturers often fail at metrics like POST time, and the CG-IW here takes around 10 seconds longer to POST than other Z370 boards from top-tier vendors. For most of the rest of the throughput benchmarks, the system was in the often within a percentage point of the top performing system, albeit in the bottom half of the stack.", " ", "Our overclocking results were a bit disappointing. In fact, due to the 65W imposed BIOS limit at stock speeds, during any testing that included AVX (Prime95, POVRay, and Blender) we saw power limit throttling which resulted in lower scoring benchmarks. Once the power limit was raised, the results were right in line with the rest of the data sets we have, except in peak frequency. Auto overclocking didn't yield much as it raised the voltage too high almost immediately, causing current limits to be hit. Manual overclocking wasn't terribly fruitful either. We were able to push all core clocks to 4.4 GHz on this board, whereas the other Z370 boards tested happily ran up to 5 GHz. The issue here according to Intel XTU was Current Limit Throttling. The problem is the board doesn't appear to have settings for current we can raise to get around it. If pushing heavy overclocks is your thing, you will have to look at other boards (ASUS ROG Strix Z370I Gaming for example). On the memory side, the board is only rated to DDR4-2666, however our DDR-3200 kit ran when XMP was applied.", "For connectivity, the C7Z370-CG-IW has one full-length PCIe slot, connected via CPU, and no others on the board. The back panel I/O has a legacy PS/2 port, four USB 3.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.2 port, an HDMI 2.0 port, the Realtek Wi-Fi card, an Intel I219-V port, two USB 3.1 ports, and the 7.1 channel audio stack. The number of USB ports available on the back may be a bit light for some.

What follows is a bit of known and a bit of unknown.", "Starting at the top, bluechip states that AMD is planning to launch a Z490 platform in June. This is somewhat new to us, although we have sources mention inklings of a Z490 chipset coming. At that time I assumed it was just a mental mistake of confusing it with an Intel platform, but now distributors are stating that AMD has a Z490 chipset coming, which essentially confirms the case. It looks like the future is going to revolve around AMD and Intel having the same chipset names it seems. Whether this platform will come in June or not we are unsure – June is Computex time. As for the features, that is currently unknown – AMD does trail Intel by a long way for what their chipsets can do, such as PCIe lane counts or embedded Wi-Fi.", "Next is AMD’s B450 chipset for late July, which is an expected release.

At CES, AMD stated that second generation TR would be coming in the second half of the year, and the presentation lists it as August, so essentially a year since the original TR release.", "For Intel, discussion on when exactly Z390 is coming out (or another 14nm processor) has been rife. Z370 has now been out for around six months, powering the Coffee Lake processors, and the recent mid-range chipset update with integrated Wi-Fi has been expected to come into the high-end. We still do not know what exactly Z390 is bringing to the market, but bluechip lists it as a Q3 launch. So chances are we probably will not see many motherboards at Computex.", "The interesting processor element to this presentation is that it lists an 8-core Coffee Lake processor being launched in Q4, while also stating that engineering samples are going to be in the hands of OEMs in June. This part of the slide is clearly cut/pasted from an Intel presentation, with what clearly looks like a watermark for whoever had the NDA. Some OEMs have accidentally let slip that an 8-core mainstream processor from Intel was inbound during 2018, and this is additional confirmation. I suspect that what people were not expecting was the date of Q4: if we take the exact placement of the arrow in the graph as the due date (as the other arrows seem as accurately spaced), then it would suggest a late November launch.", "No word in the presentation was given to Cascade Lake or an X299 refresh, which could be interpreted as that we might see it in 2019, or bluechip does not have that information. They clearly list X99 Refresh on the Intel Chipset Roadmap slide, so to see the X299 Refresh label missing could lead to certain predictions, but we have no source on when an update to X299 is due."]},

If three M.2 slots are not enough, MSI includes an add-in card for two additional x4 PCIe 3.0 M.2 slots for a total of five. Unique to certain MSI boards, the top M.2 heatsink is hinged at the base with the chipset heatsink and is held in place by a tab which slides to release. The heatsink is designed to be more robust than the other two slots and potentially do a better job cooling. All that being said, the first two M.2 slots are powered by the chipset: only the third M.2 slot uses PCIe lanes from the CPU. In addition to the M.2 slots for storage, the XPower Gaming AC has a U.2 port (also from the chipset) and a total of 10 SATA ports with eight fed from the chipset and two from an ASMedia controller. ", "For the overclockers, MSI implements a couple of very useful features, especially when pushing the limits. In the upper right-hand corner, by the debug LED, are plus and minus buttons used to overclock either BCLK and CPU Ratio while in Windows. Right around that area are voltage read points which cover the major voltage domains including Vcore. It also has jumpers to force enter the BIOS bypassing errors, a dual BIOS, and even a slow mode switch used to get through POST at a low clock speed increasing stability when using liquid nitrogen and extreme overclocks. ", "In the way of USB connectivity, the XPower has USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) Type-A and Type-C on the rear panel, with ports run from the latest and more efficient ASMedia 3142 controller. In addition to the rear panel, the motherboard does have a header for front panel USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) as well.

ASUS has cut the Apex into a more esoteric shape, almost like an X, to differentiate itself from other products on the market. It is a little odd, given generations of rectangles, although it is worth noting that motherboards do not have to be rectangles at all - as long as it fits in the standard, go crazy. The Apex fits the standard, requiring an E-ATX chassis, and the extra PCB area is used extensively for features.", "The Maximus X Apex, by both pricing and feature set, places it in the high-end enthusiast segment for the Z370 platform. The Apex includes a lot of features focused on overclocking but is well rounded enough to do anything from gaming to workstation level activities. An example of the overclocking pedigree is in the upper right-hand corner, where there are several buttons, switches, and voltage read points that are all dedicated overclocking features to make extreme competitive overclocking easier.", "To that end, the board uses two DRAM slots rather than the four we would normally expect to see on full-size, premium cost motherboards. ASUS mentions this was done to have better trace routing and helps with higher memory speed support, but also gives room for features such as DIMM.2, as shown below. The Apex also includes an Aquantia AQC108 5G LAN port for faster network connectivity and also has a bright RGB LED implementation. The ROG Maximus X Apex is a board aimed at users who want all of the performance out of this platform while not falling short most anywhere else. ", "The performance results for the Maximus X Apex placed it at the top of most of our benchmarks so far, leading nearly across the board from our small set of 300-series boards. The only point to pick up on might be the idle power consumption being higher, but that should be expected with a board like this with the extra functionality. ", "When manually overclocking our i7-8700K, it was met with no resistance from the board itself. We were easily able to push this CPU to 5.1 GHz passing our tests. 5.2 GHz brought us to a major voltage wall requiring an additional 0.1 volts, pushing our CPU temperatures well past the 90C limit we use. The automated overclocking (5-Way Optimization) through AI Suite 3 yielded a slight increase in performance, about 100 MHz for all threads (including AVX offset) and 300 MHz for single threaded clock speeds. The large aluminum heatsink covering the power delivery was able to keep them well within specification regardless of manual or auto overclocking. ", "The ROG Maximus X Apex removes M.2 connections on the motherboard and relies solely on the DIMM.2 add-in-card to attach any M.2 devices (SATA, PCIe, Optane). The add-in-card comes with a bracket in order to attach fans (sold separately) used to cool the devices below it. For SATA connected storage, the Apex gives users four ports, supporting RAID 0/1/5/10. The platform typically includes six SATA ports which are native to the chipset, but with four in use allows the board not to share PCIe resources with the SATA ports. ", "Somewhat unusual for the mainstream Z370 platform, the Apex comes with a total of four full-length PCIe slots (and two PCIe x1 slots). Three of the four full-length slots (grey reinforced) are connected to the CPU and will run at x16, x8/x8, or x8/x4/x4. The full-length slot at the bottom runs at x4 speeds from the chipset, and the x1 slots run at x1. This configuration allows the Apex to support both SLI (two card) and up to 4-way Crossfire.", "The Apex is not the highest end overclocking motherboard that ASUS offers on Z370, so one might assume that it does not compete directly with other halo motherboards. Ultimately it squares against anything that the competition has geared towards overclocking. Normally this would be products like the GIGABYTE SOC Force, the ASRock OC Formula, and the MSI XPower, however there is no Z370 SOC Force, there is no Z370 OC Formula, and there is no Z370 XPower.

No prior warning was given, and we were expecting something similar to perhaps pop up during Computex in a few weeks, but it would seem that Intel has pulled the plug during a Sunday (which makes me think this was an accidental posting, but I’m not complaining).", "Z390 is the second generation of high-end chipset for Intel’s 300-series platform for Coffee Lake desktop processors. It builds on Z370 in two obvious areas: chipset support for up to six USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) ports, and introduces a built in wireless networking MAC for dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi use via Intel’s new integrated connectivity feature. This uses Intel’s 802.11ac Wave 2 configuration, suitable for up to 160 MHz wireless bands. These additions mirror what we saw when Intel launched the low-range and mid-range chipsets such as H370, B360, and H310, in early April.", "Overall, this disclosure essentially paints a picture of how Coffee Lake CPUs were initially launched. It appears to be that the chipsets with USB 3.1 and integrated Wi-Fi were not expected to be ready when the CPUs were to be launched, and so Z370 came out as a Z270 refresh but for Coffee Lake only. Now that the chipset designs with USB 3.1 and Wi-Fi are ready, we are seeing Z390 as the true high-end chipset for Intel’s mainstream platform.", " ", "", "Comparing the Z370 and Z390 general block diagrams side by side showcases the two differences listed above: on the left are the new USB 3.1 ports and on the right is the integrated Wi-Fi MAC. As with other Z-series chipsets, these allow overclocking, and are also not vPro enabled (Q-series only).", "Other standard features include RAID support, RSTe, Optane Memory support (as Boot and non-Boot drives), and HSIO lanes.", "The first headline feature is the integrated 2T2R 802.11ac Wi-Fi support, allowing the latest Wave 2 (160 MHz) channel communications and giving speeds up to 1733 Mbps. Intel states that this is 12x faster than 1T1R 802.11n support provided by low cost solutions, and double the performance of most 2T2R options on the market. Despite Intel support however, not all motherboards that use a chipset that offers this feature will have it implemented: we canvassed some of the manufacturers and were told that the periphery around Wi-Fi support, such as manufacturing, trace layouts, the companion module, antenna, and potential regulatory support (given devices shipping with Wi-Fi) can add an additional $15 cost to the motherboard. While Z390 is the high end chipset, it will span a range of prices from the low $130 range all the way up, so some motherboards may not have this feature in order to save cost.", "Intel’s Wi-Fi solution relies on its integrated connectivity feature, CNVi, enabled in Gemini Lake and now in the latest 8th Gen processors. This method pushes the large/expensive functional blocks from the Wi-Fi module (such as the logic, MAC, and memory) directly onto the chipset, leaving the PHY and antenna on the companion RF module (CRF). These connect together through the CNVio interface via a specialised M.2 slot. Intel’s own webpage on the feature states that it has three different CRFs possible, all under the ‘Jefferson Peak’ platform codename:", "All three CRFs support Linux, Chrome OS, and Windows 10, but are only offered with a 1 year warranty.", "The second headline feature is the support for USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) ports native to the chipset. This is using Intel’s own IP, and shows Intel reaching parity with the competition. Motherboard manufacturers will have to use HSIO lanes to enable USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) ports, with up to four being supported on H370/B360, and six being supported on Q370 and Z390. In order to implement a Type-C port, a re-driver is required, as with other Type-C implementations. It will be interesting to see the number of 10 Gbps ports that are put into play on the motherboards available.", "Also on the plate for the chipsets are features like Modern Standby/Smart Connect, allowing for systems to update email and such while in a sleep state similar to some laptops. Intel was proud to state that this is the first time the feature has come to the desktop, whereas previously it was seen more as a laptop-focused feature. This is enabled through the chipset and the network connection, and while Intel only lists the 1T1R enabled CRFs as supporting this feature, the 2T2R does as well.", "Intel also lists ‘ambient computing’ as being enabled by the chipset. This allows for wake-on-voice in a low powered mode, much like a smartphone or connected device that the user can call Cortana or Alexa while the system is in screen-off or Modern Standby.", "The main differences depends on if you use USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) ports, or Wi-Fi. If those features are something already in use on the Z370 board in play, then the only difference is that the Z390 motherboard might* use slightly less power (less than a few watts) or that the Z390 version might* have been slightly cheaper. But if anything, you are not missing out on that much. If you do not use those features, then there is no real loss.", "I fully expect that motherboard manufacturers have manufactured plenty of Z370 models that Z390 will be earmarked mostly for the high-end and that both will be sold side-by-side. For example, ASUS has not launched a Maximus X Extreme yet, neither have ASRock launched an OC Formula on this platform, so it is likely that these will be on Z390 only. I would expect, stock permitting, that new designs down the like, such as future revisions to motherboard designs, will be using the newer Z390 chipsets where it makes sense to do so. However expect reviews of both Z370 and Z390 boards for the next few months at a minimum.", "Computex is the first week of June.

{"title": "EVGA Forgoes Driver DVDs: It’s All About The USB Flash Drive", "paragraph": ["Driver disks of some sort have been part of a PC enthusiast's life as far back as I can remember. Before Windows included drivers, they all came from media included with the motherboard. I first recall them on floppies then once optical media took hold, moved to CDs. As the number of drivers and included software increased in both quantity and size, it outgrew the capacity of CDs and board partners moved to DVDs offering more capacity and faster read speeds. For example, a board partner's driver disk from a Z370 based board weighs in at 6.57GB on the disk, far eclipsing the capacity of a CD (~700MB) and that of a single-sided DVD (4.7 GB).", "To that end, yesterday on Twitter, EVGA’s Global Product Management Director Jacob Freeman announced that in the future, EVGA motherboards will not come with driver disks, but USB Flash which contains all the needed drivers and software. This includes H370 based boards now and others moving forward. Instead of a DVD we are used to seeing, EVGA will include a small 8GB USB flash drive with the EVGA logo printed on it instead. While this isn’t a first (a high-end Asus board in the past included one), it certainly is welcome, if only for the quick installation from USB versus CD/DVD installs. The drive is also re-writeable so it can be used for other purposes as well. ", " ", "Overall, it is good to see EVGA embrace what we feel is the modern, and faster, medium for base driver and software installations, and hope other board partners follow suit. I do wonder a bit about the cost, but even if it adds $1 more, it is worth it (to me). No more whirring from the optical drive to install drivers with H370 and future EVGA motherboards. It’s about time!", "Editor's Note: EVGA has confirmed the drive is USB 2.0 based and costs about twenty times more than an optical disk would. Thankfully, EVGA says that significant cost increase will not trickle down to the consumer, which we all appreciate. ", "I highly doubt that other manufactures will switch to USB drives anytime soon considering the cost is about 20x that of a DVD.

The presentation was relatively light on details – perhaps purposefully so – however Intel SVP and GM Gregory Bryant stated that the processor was set to come out during Q4.", "You can read our coverage about the launch in this article:", "We also had a chance to examine the system that the demo was run on, in particular the cooling method and the motherboard. We have this article here:", "Now there were obviously a lot of questions about the demonstration. Was the CPU overclocked? What cooling was used? What platform did it run on? Which motherboard did it run on? What architecture is being used? What process node? What was the power consumption? We met with an Intel representative yesterday who answered some of these questions.", "The Intel representative did confirm the CPU was overclocked. We were told that on stage the presenter was actually meant to clarify that the system was overclocked, however the specific wording was not stated as it had been prepared.", "There are many ways to interpret this – we did tell Intel that we had hoped that the presenter would have spent more time on stage talking about the system in play, discussing the platform it was running on, and making the system more ‘bright’ inside so that people could determine several things from photographs, rather than it looking almost like a black box with hidden pipes. Our commentary was taken on board by the Intel team we spoke to.", "Intel confirmed that a water chiller was used, which we saw in our system demo examination the day after the presentation. We were told that it was not intended to showcase the cooling on the stage due to time constraints, to which we responded that Intel’s implementation of pre-overclocked systems in the past are typically accompainied a discussion on the pre-overclocked nature and the cooling used in the past, yet this presentation did not have this.", "In our pre-briefing it was stated that this was a technical showcase (the bit where it was stated that this was coming to market was a bit of a shock if we’re honest), however this was not communicated as well as it should have been on stage. Again, Intel stated that they were taking our comments on board.", "Intel did not answer this platform directly, however it was clear that the CPU was aimed at the LGA3647 server-based socket given from our examination of the demo system. It was unclear how Intel was going to promote this as an extreme workstation-type system, however Intel did note that they expect only a select market to be interested in this type of processor: a niche of a niche.", "Intel know very well that there is a crowd of its customers that will buy performance at any price, and it doesn’t take a leap to suggest that this part is for those users.", "At the time of the presentation, Intel stated that they had partnered with both ASUS and GIGABYTE to create systems around the new 28-core product, however they didn’t state which system the 5 GHz demo was run on. We heard from both of the motherboard companies that it was actually the GIGABYTE system that hit 5 GHz, however it was noted that Intel did not explicitly call out the partner that hit the milestone. GIGABYTE confirmed that they certainly hit 5 GHz; we have yet to speak to ASUS on the matter. We do know that Intel quickly removed the CPUs in the demo systems from ASUS and GIGABYTE the next day with little notice. In between those times we have seen videos published from LinusTechTips (on ASUS) and Paul’s Hardware (on GIGABYTE) showing a Cinebench run.", "The only item that Intel would confirm here is that the 28-core processor is built on one of its 14nm nodes. For anyone thinking it was a 10nm node, this confirms that it was not, however it does not say much more; Intel is purposefully keeping its cards close to its chest on this one. The smart money seems to be that the chip is likely to at least be based on the Skylake-X processors, like the 28-core Xeon Platinum 8176 or Xeon Platinum 8180, rather than the future Cascade Lake platform, however Intel has also promised that the consumer version of Cascade Lake-X will be coming by the end of the year.", "Speaking with the motherboard vendors and OEMs in general about Intel’s HEDT plans is a tricky business, but most seem to be focused on their current X299 motherboards right now rather than a series of X299 refreshes that normally accompany an HEDT update.", "Again, this was one of the items that Intel wants to keep close to its chest. After confirming that the 5.0 GHz number was an overclocked value, it does mean that the base TDP for a ‘retail’ processor will be much lower, as the chip will be running at much lower clocks. The Xeon Platinum 8180 has a base frequency of 2.5 GHz and a turbo of 3.8 GHz for a TDP of 205W (TDP being defined at the base frequency only), and we know that the LGA3647 socket by its Intel reference design was made for chips up to 265W, so the frequency of the 28-core part shown by Intel for extreme workstations is only likely to be a +100-400 MHz more at most.", "Interestingly enough, Intel states the maximum operating temperature of the 8180 at 205W TDP as 84C case temperature and 98C DTS, which sounds slightly higher than its standard settings for enterprise chips. It would mean that this new 28-core, if it comes out at 265W TDP, is likely to be a super high bin of the part. Of course, this will come with a higher cost.", "One of the interesting numbers to come out of the initial announcement were that overclockers were seeing 1000W power draw for an 18-core Core i9-7980XE at 4.9 GHz, so one would assume that a 28-core at 5.0 GHz would be more. We know that the demo that achieved 5.0 GHz was using a Hailea water chiller capable of 1770W of cooling, and the system being used had a 1600W power supply with a low power graphics card. That gives us a good idea for low-bound and high-bound. However Intel would not help narrow down our estimates.", "One of our points to Intel was that the story around the 28-core announcement was not ideally communicated. (", ") The systems holding the machines were not very well described in what they were doing, leading to massive amounts of speculation. The insides of the systems were dimly lit, and the cooling apparatus was hidden. Intel could have made the story around the parts be about the technology behind the demonstration, and the ability to push the limits of the hardware to new heights, however, even if the word ‘overclocked’ was accidentally not said on stage, these part of the story was not explained. Not in the ‘it wasn’t explained well’, it just wasn’t explained period. The best thing Intel can do at this point is to grab the story by the horns, and show that this is a passion project: let the readers and reviewers know about the platform, about the implementation (even if new explicit information isn’t shared), and that it actually takes a good amount of engineering prowess and skill to put on a 28-core, 5.0 GHz demonstration.", "As it stands, we await further information."]},

This management control boots a separate subsystem that can power off/on the main machine, manage networking, and also track users or onboard sensors for fans/thermals and report back to a central server. They also typically support interfaces to interact with the main machine directly.

Tyan is the first company to make their Ryzen+BMC product public.", "The Tyan Tomcat EX is based on the A320 chipset, showing that it is perhaps more for the lower end of the market, but does have dual gigabit Ethernet and a full set of memory slots. The big thing with the fan is the E8860 graphics in the embedded graphics version, but Tyan stated the BMC version will be in production in September this year. It is worth noting that we would expect both versions of the motherboard to be built on the same base PCB design, however this PCB does not seem to have room/pads for a BMC module.

{"title": "AMD BIOS Limitations: Bristol Ridge Dropped From Certain Motherboards", "paragraph": ["One of the functions of a motherboard BIOS, or UEFI, is the ability to discern which CPU is installed in the socket. With each new generation of CPUs, new versions of BIOS firmware are launched such that the new processors can be detected and run. It is impossible to know in advance which CPUs are coming out 12-24 months in the future, so users need to update their BIOS before updating CPUs.", "Users who have invested in AMD’s AM4 platform, pairing a Ryzen-2000 series CPU or APU with an early revision of the A320/B350/X370 motherboards might already be too familiar with this: buying a motherboard which should support the CPU on the latest BIOS, but the retailer has older stock which has not been updated. To solve this, AMD initiated a program whereby the company would send the user an early-series Bristol Ridge processor and cooler so the user could get the system to Boot, then the user can update the BIOS to use the new processor. Similar issues happen with Intel’s platforms as well, although they have been publicised less as Intel uses new sockets and chipsets more frequently.", "One of the advantages of updating sockets and chipsets more frequently is that the microcode required for previous generations of processors is not in the BIOS. By having a socket and platform that has a long life span, in order to support every processor, the BIOS has to contain all the microcode required for those processors. All of it. This can cause problems, such as the problems that some motherboard manufacturers are facing today.", "During Computex, several manufacturers told us one of two things: either they would be dropping support for Bristol Ridge processors on some systems, or they have had to increase the size of the BIOS chip in order to retain support.", "Most motherboards in the market use a single 128 Mb (mega-bit, 16 megabytes) BIOS chip that has to contain all the data and code for the system to be able to detect the processor and train the memory to the correct frequency. It would appear that for some motherboard vendors, due to the features in their BIOS, are now running out of space. Because of the age of Bristol Ridge, and the fact that the processors were not widely distributed at retail in the first place, the range of processors seem to be getting the chop from certain motherboard models.", "", "The simple way to support all the processors is to increase the size of the BIOS chip, by moving from 128 Mb to 256 Mb. At least two vendors told us that the price of these larger chips is more than double the 128 Mb chips. Not only this, but they have so many 128 Mb chips in stock already (or purchase agreements), it would not be economically feasible to switch and dump. One company, Biostar, said that they were implementing motherboards with two BIOS chips in a striped configuration, giving an effective capacity of 256 Mb, in order to solve this issue. The only downside here is that the system is using two BIOS chips, effectively doubling the cost to implement a BIOS on the motherboard. For low end systems, this is an additional cost that might push the product out of a competitive price range.", "Another solution would be to bifurcate BIOS versions, giving one support for Bristol Ridge but not the latest processors, and a second for the latest. The danger here is that if a user flashes to the wrong version or the Bristol Ridge BIOS version might be put to legacy very quickly, and not receive relevant security updates if needed.", "To date AMD has launched / announced a total of 45+ processors for the AM4 platform. This rises to 55 with the recent GE and Athlon models, and more if the BIOS listings about more Ryzen-2000 series processors are to be believed.", "For context, we did some counting on our internal processor database, and the top sockets that should have interchangeable processors are as follows:", "Judging by these numbers, the number of AM4 processors is actually relatively small compared to some of the big ones. Either that means the microcode per processor on AM4 is much larger, or the base code required for the platform is much larger.", "The overall take-home message is that we will start seeing BIOSes that remove support for Bristol Ridge, and/or Bristol Ridge Pro, or we might end up with AM4 motherboards targeted towards certain processor families only. The best way to get around this would be for all motherboards to get a bigger BIOS chip (or use two chips and stripe), however that does not do much for the motherboards that are already on the market.", "Update:", "I should add that another way to solve this issue is to have simpler BIOS interfaces. The drive in recent years to have flashy all-singing and all-dancing UEFI interfaces has made the BIOS file bloom in size. It may be a case that some vendors will exchange features in the UEFI interface in order to support these chips. ", "Update 2:", "People have asked questions about upcoming Ryzen CPUs, and if these motherboards might drop support for other chips as well. There are two ways to think about this: either the microcode for the Ryzen/Zen based chips has a lot of commonality that this shouldn't be too much of an issue, or we might see some BIOSes drop support for the Ryzen Pro CPUs, as they are not often sold at retail. I suspect that motherboard vendors will be moving quickly such that all future motherboards should not have any of these issues, however that doesn't say much about the current boards on the market."]},

It feels like every board partner has released another range of motherboards in all shapes and sizes, including in the Small Form Factor (SFF) space. Users looking at any of these non-Z series of motherboards are normally focused on using a locked processor (as the platform does not overclock) to maximise performance per dollar but also these chips are rated at 65W TDP or below, so power consumption or noise is usually on the mind. Users who want a less costly way into the latest Intel platform can find it in these new H and B series boards. ", "With that in mind, we have had an opportunity to look at the GIGABYTE H370N WIFI Mini-ITX motherboard. The SFF board gives users nearly all the connectivity wanted in a 6.7 x 6.7 package. The H370N includes dual M.2 slots for high-speed storage, four SATA ports for HDDs/SSDs, an 802.11ac Wave2 Wi-Fi module with 1.73 Gbps bandwidth, and a USB Type-C port on the back panel. For those looking for RGB LED illumination, it has that as well in the bottom left-hand corner on the back side of the board.

Users looking for multiple Intel network ports are also sorted, as GIGABYTE installed two on this board - one I219-V, and one I211-AT.", "From our analysis, the performance on the small board was about on par with the other 300-series motherboard datasets, sitting on the lower part of the bell curve throughout. In most of the results, it was within a run variance away from being on the top. Where the H370N WIFI shined was in the power consumption testing where on load it used around 20W less than its competitors at the same clock speeds. Idle power use was also quite low making this a good option for those who are looking to save a few pennies on the electric bill compared to other higher-end chipset offerings. ", "The SFF board has two M.2 slots, one located on the front, the other on the back, both able to support PCIe modules and one able to support both PCIe and SATA devices. On such a small board, having two M.2 slots is a luxury. In addition to the M.2 slots, there are four SATA3  ports located just to the right of the two DRAM slots which support RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10.

As a result, GIGABYTE only offers two motherboard options to date: the gaming-focused AORUS X399 Gaming 7 and the feature-packed X399 Designare EX, but we do know that an ", " is also set to be released in the near future. In this review, we are having a look at the X399 Designare EX, the current GIGABYTE Halo implementation of AMD's X399 chipset.", "The Designare EX is the most expensive and feature-packed motherboard GIGABYTE has to offer, yet its features seem to have been selected with productivity in mind. For example, gaming-specific features such as an Intel E2500 Killer LAN gaming chipset are implemented on the cheaper AORUS Gaming 7 motherboard, yet not on the Designare EX, instead going for dual Intel networking ports and Wi-Fi. As its name hints, GIGABYTE is probably targeting this motherboard more towards professionals and designers.", "The GIGABYTE X399 Designare EX is a motherboard designed to be both feature-packed and reliable. Its list of features is very long and, despite the massive size of the processor's socket and the eight DDR4 RAM slots, the dimensions of the GIGABYTE X399 Designare EX are exactly those of a typical ATX motherboard, allowing it to be installed inside any typical ATX-compliant case.", "A quick glance at the motherboard's specifications reveals that up to eight SATA drives and three M.2 drives can be connected on the GIGABYTE X399 Designare EX. The motherboard does not have a U.2 drive connector, making GIGABYTE the only manufacturer who did not add one on their top-tier AMD X399 motherboard. However, GIGABYTE supplies a U.2 to M.2 adapter, allowing the connection of a U.2 drive onto any of the motherboard's three M.2 slots. The motherboard also has a massive number of USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports and there are also two USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, one Type-A and one Type-C.", "In terms of connectivity, the motherboard has dual Intel I211-AT Gigabit LAN controllers, plus an Intel 802.11ac/Bluetooth 4.2 wireless adapter. The I211-AT are renowned for their efficiency and stability (and it is not bad for gaming either). The wireless card supports speeds up to 867 Mbps.", "GIGABYTE heavily advertises the audio capabilities of the X399 Designare EX, focusing on the Creative Sound BlasterX 720° support. Note that Sound BlasterX 720° is not a chipset but a software package that is designed to work with any compatible chipset/motherboard. Realtek supplies the well-known ALC 1220 audio chipset that also has an integrated smart headphones amplifier.", "One of the truly unique features of the GIGABYTE X399 Designare EX is the presence of a fifth full-length PCIe slot. Like every other AMD X399 motherboard, the GIGABYTE X399 Designare EX has four PCI Express slots that are directly connected to CPU lanes (×16 / ×8 /×16 / ×8), but right in the middle of these four slots, the Designare has an added a fifth full-length PCI Express slot with four lanes connecting to the chipset.", "The second important feature of the GIGABYTE X399 Designare EX is the implementation of an International Rectifier IR35201 digital controller. What is unique about this particular controller is that it implements an algorithm that balances the load (and the heat output) across all of the power phases. This means that instead of having a couple of stages heavily loaded all of the time while the rest are idling, all eight stages are continuously sharing about the same load, greatly increasing the longevity of the circuitry. This means that the motherboard should hold up well for the upcoming ", " launch.", "Overall, the X399 Designare EX is a motherboard that seems to be leaning more towards professionals. There are gaming-related features, such as RGB lighting and support for external RGB strips, but these are more of an exception rather than the rule. The company refrained from adding gaming-focused chipsets or complex/untested circuitry, sticking to heavily tested and proven choices. As we will see in the following pages, GIGABYTE also focused on the cooling capabilities and the physical strength of the motherboard a lot as well, hinting that the X399 Designare EX has been developed in order to please users who seek stability and reliability above all else."]},

With Threadripper 2 around the corner, sporting support for up to 32 cores and 250W TDP, a couple of the motherboard manufacturers are building X399 ‘refresh’ motherboards that are optimized for the new processors, and this is MSI’s very impressive effort.", "The headline from this motherboard is the 19 power phases, arranged as 16 for the processor. This is likely a four-phase implementation with two doublers, but still comes in as eight more than the amount of phases for the CPU compared to any other Threadripper motherboard on the market. The effect of using more phases in this way means that the power multiplexing over time that occurs between phases gives each phase less time being the primary phase, as well as splitting the delivery with other segments, reducing the overall load and allowing for more headroom and/or better longevity. The power delivery is also sided with two 8-pin EPS 12V connectors.", "The reason why most motherboard manufacturers only use eight is because the socket and memory design is bulky: ultimately there is only enough space for six phases, or eight if a smaller choke design is used. In order to fit sixteen, MSI has had to push the socket and memory down, forcing the manufacturer to choose to either lose one of the PCIe slots, or extend the board vertically (they seem to have done the latter). But this also gives the manufacturer a larger choice for phases and chokes with fewer space constraints, if a good enough power delivery heatsink is also applied. In these cases it sometimes requires more PCB layers to help with power/ground and routing, and MSI is using eight which is a high number for a consumer motherboard (usually 4-8, rarely 10), but not the highest (and server/workstation boards often use from 6 to 12 depending on the feature set).", "On the board MSI is using a dual power delivery heatsink design, connecting the main power delivery heatsink by a heatpipe to a heatsink next to the rear panel that also helps to cool all the networking options. One thing to note is the styling on the heatsink and the board: it is very angled, and my feedback to MSI is that the board looks very busy. This is going to be MSI’s halo Threadripper 2 motherboard, and to be honest, the styling needs a good amount of work.", "For a Halo motherboard, MSI is supporting four PCIe slots from the processor, although without water cooling only 3-way is going to be used due to PCIe slot spacing. Between the slots is an M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, with another slot actually next to the DRAM slots, as the board is also extended in width as well (making it E-ATX). MSI will be bundling its Quad M.2 PCIe 3.0 x16 card when the board is sold, giving a total of six M.2 slots. MSI says that it supports seven M.2 total, although the last one does not seem to be obvious, so it could be on the rear of the motherboard. There is no U.2 slot, as it seems that the form factor is basically dead for the consumer market.", "For controllers, MSI has equipped the X399 Creation with dual Intel gigabit Ethernet ports, and an Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi. For a halo motherboard I was expecting to see Aquantia’s 5G or 10G controller, however we do not get that here. There is no Thunderbolt either, but there are four USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) ports on the rear (one Type-C), and at least eight USB 3.0 ports, four or six of which on the back panel and two onboard headers for cases. There is also a Type-C onboard header, but it is not obvious if this is USB 3.0 or USB 3.1. Audio will be with an upgraded Realtek ALC1220 codec solution, with PCB separation between digital and analog signals and additional filter caps.", "", "One of the features that MSI was keen to promote is that the board supports 10 fan headers in PWM mode but also three user-positioned thermal sensors that will be bundled in the box. This will allow users to define their thermal environment, with the software, how they need to.", "We expect the MSI X399 Creation (or is it MSI MEG Creation?) to come to the market sometime soon, before the launch of Threadripper 2, or perhaps the same day as a launch partner with the processor.

Although the Ryzen Threadripper (currently) is not an appealing processor for casual gaming, when a gamer also wants to be concurrently downloading, chatting, and transcoding a video in the background while streaming a game online, the many cores of the Threadripper start making sense. The X399 Professional Gaming is ASRock's most featured-packed motherboard, with a very impressive list of specifications.

On the contrary, the aesthetic design is subtle, yet elegant, focused on simple geometric shapes. Onboard RGB lighting is present but is limited around the chipset's heatsink, with headers for additional LED strips. We also spotted very high-quality components, such as the Nichicon solid-state capacitors that account for every single capacitor on this motherboard.", "In terms of connectivity, the ASRock X399 Professional Gaming supports up to three M.2 PCIe ×4 drives, one U.2 PCIe ×4 drive, and eight SATA drives. Each of the M.2 sockets have four PCIe lanes with no sharing between them and/or with other devices, except for one of the M.2 slots to be switched with the U.2 port. Using the U.2 connector will disable one of the M.2 ports entirely. It is not possible for two devices to be installed with shared lanes.", "A look at the rear panel of the motherboard reveals that the ASRock X399 Professional Gaming has three network interface controllers (NICs), plus the Wi-Fi 802.11ac/Bluetooth 4.2 module. Two of the NICs are typical gigabit chips from Intel (211AT) but the third is an Aquantia 10GBASE-T chip, the AQC107. This level of network connectivity is needless for a gaming motherboard and none of the used chipsets are designed exclusively for gaming, it should be noted. The use of three NICs is one of this motherboard's unique features but, on the other hand, this approach does not make much sense for a gaming motherboard. A gaming-specific NIC such as a Killer E2500 would make the motherboard more appealing to gamers, whereas the more expensive Aquantia 10G chip primarily serves other users.", "The second feature that stands out is the 11-phase (8+3) power design with a fully digital PWM controller and separated CPU connectors. We will examine the circuitry in more detail in the following pages of this review. The sound chipset is provided by Realtek and is the ALC1220. It supports the Sound Blaster Cinema 3 software and ASRock is using Nichicon's golden audio-specific capacitors to drive the physically isolated audio channels.
