The impetus for this is quite clear: as SSDs get faster in each generation, RAID arrays have a major problem of maintaining (and scaling up) performance. Even in cases where the RAID operations are handled by a dedicated RAID card, a simple write request in, say, a RAID 5 array would involve two reads and two writes to different drives. In cases where there is no hardware acceleration, the data from the reads needs to travel all the way back to the CPU and main memory for further processing before the writes can be done.", "Kioxia has proposed the use of the PCIe direct memory access feature along with the SSD controller's controller memory buffer (CMB) to avoid the movement of data up to the CPU and back. The required parity computation is done by an accelerator block resident within the SSD controller.", "In Kioxia's PoC implementation, the DMA engine can access the entire host address space (including the peer SSD's BAR-mapped CMB), allowing it to receive and transfer data as required from neighboring SSDs on the bus. Kioxia noted that their offload PoC saw close to 50% reduction in CPU utilization and upwards of 90% reduction in system DRAM utilization compared to software RAID done on the CPU. The proposed offload scheme can also handle scrubbing operations without taking up the host CPU cycles for the parity computation task.", "Kioxia has already taken steps to contribute these features to the NVM Express working group.

PSSDs employing native UFD controllers almost always win on this metric over bridge-based solutions. Some use-cases may preclude the possibility of utilizing a separate cable. For such scenarios, one of the 'SSD-in-a-stick' models may be the optimal choice. QLC-based options should be avoided for write-heavy use-cases.

Not to be confused with the Terminator T-700, the T700's product page has already gone live but still lacks some of the M.2 2280 SSD's finer details. However, it does show some basic specifications that suggest that the T700 will deliver higher performance than rival first-generation PCIe 5.0 drives.", "Different as they may look, the first wave of SSDs all have something in common: they leverage Phison's PS5026-E26 PCIe 5.0 controller and its eight-channel design. There are other PCIe 5.0 SSD controllers for storage vendors to pick from, including Silicon Motion's SM2508 or InnoGrit's IG5666. However, the E26 has become the de facto PCIe 5.0 controller for PCIe 5.0 SSDs.", "The T700, like many rivals before it, utilizes the E26 controller. Crucial rates the T700 with sequential read and writes up to 12.4 GB/s and 11.8 GB/s, respectively. It's twice as fast as the P5 Plus PCIe 4.0 SSD and up to 22 times faster than the MX500 SATA SSD. Crucial has granted ", " a small preview of the T700. An extract from the previewer's guide has exposed the T700's sequential and random performance. According to the snippet, the expected sequential read and write performance on the T700 is 12 GB/s and 11 GB/s. The figures are somewhat lower than the specifications from the T700's product page. The T700's numbers reach 1.5 million IOPS reads and writes regarding random performance. The performance varies slightly between the different capacities.", "If the T700 delivers on the claims, it would make the drive one of the fastest PCIe 5.0 SSDs and put it ahead of its competitors, such as the Corsair MP700, Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000, or the MSI Spatium M570 Pro. The only faster drives in development are Adata's Project Nighthawk and Project Blackbird SSDs, with sequential read and write speeds of 14 GB/s and 12 GB/s and 14 GB/s and 10 GB/s, respectively.

Unfortunately, current PCIe 5.0 SSDs are far from exploiting the E26's full potential due to the limited supplies of that newest-generation NAND. Many drives sport 1,600 MT/s NAND, so they fail to break the 10 GB/s barrier. Like its competitors, the Crucial T700 uses Micron 232-layer 3D TLC NAND chips. Micron's 232-layer NAND runs at different speeds: 1,600 MT/s, 2,000 MT/s, and 2,400 MT/s. Crucial didn't specify the grade of the NAND with the T700, but given the SSD's advertised performance, it stands to reason that the drive likely uses the 2,000 MT/s variant. There are obvious perks to Micron being the parent company. Crucial likely has dibs on the higher-binned NAND chips, so securing 2,000 MT/s NAND isn't as big of an issue. Surprisingly, Crucial didn't equip the T700 with 2,400 MT/s, but that could be a cost-benefit decision, or 2,400 MT/s NAND yields haven't reached the point where there's a steady supply.", "Crucial offers the T700 in 1 TB, 2 TB, and 4 TB capacities. The 4 TB model has the best endurance at 2,400 TBW. The T700 is available with and without a heatsink, so the drive will fit into desktops, laptops, and gaming consoles. Linus Tech Tips' results showed the maximum operating temperatures between the T700 with the included heatsink (67 degrees Celsius) and the T700 with the motherboard heatsink (66 degrees Celsius) were similar after 15 minutes of stressing the SSD at 100% disk usage. However, there weren't any tests with the non-heatsink version. Many PCIe 5.0 SSDs come with beefy passive heatsinks, and some even have a tiny cooling fan for active cooling.

Now, a few months later, Solidigm is gearing up to release its first post-Intel SSDs, the enterprise-focused D7-P5520 and D7-P5620.", "Diving right into matters, Solidigm is essentially picking up right where Intel left off, both in regards to product design and product naming. Intel was already seeing solid market penetration with its D-series branding, so there’s little reason to give up a good thing for the new Solidigm. In any case, the new drives are designed and marketed to slot right in as the next-generation parts in the D7 lineup, which is Solidigm’s highest performance drives for the enterprise and server market.", "From a pure specification standpoint, the big news with the latest generation of drives is that Solidigm has doubled their capacities. The D7-P5620 will be available in capacities from 1.6TB to 12.8TB, while the D7-P5520 will go up to 15.36TB for its larger form factor drives. As you might expect, Solidigm is also using their own NAND here.

The only configuration difference between the drives is the amount of overprovisioning, with the P5600 drives using 20% overprovisioning to ensure faster performance, while the P5500 drives use just 4% overprovisioning to maximize capacity. Consequently, the P5620 is being pitched by the company as a mixed workload (mixed read/write) drive that can sustain up to 3 DWPD, while the P5520 is aimed at workloads with more reads than writes, with a 1 DWPD endurance.", "Given the difference in overprovisioning, the two D7 drives carry different write performance ratings. While both drives are rated for 4.2GB/second for large sequential writes, the much larger spare area on the P5620 means it's rated to sustain 390K 4K write IOPS, which is a 50% improvement over its predecessor. Though it is interesting to note that the best performing SKU, according to Solidigm's specs, is not the highest capacity 12.8TB model, but rather the 6.4TB model, which is where the quoted figures come from. The 12.8TB model actually rated for slightly lower sustained write performance and write IOPS.", "As for write performance on the P5520, that drive brings that down to 220K 4K write IOPS. Though even that is a 16% improvement over the P5510.", "Meanwhile read speeds are up slightly across the board, with both drives topping out at 1.1M read IOPS, or 7.1GB/second sequential.", "We don’t have any additional information from the company on the controller used, however based on the specifications, at this juncture there’s nothing to indicate it’s significantly different from the existing ", " controller. Though it sounds like Solidigm may be tweaking things in firmware slightly differently than Intel did, as Solidigm is focusing on read latency (especially reads under write pressure) more than Intel. In the case of the P5500 series, they’ve knocked 4K read latency down from 84μs to 75μs for the P5520; meanwhile write latency has seen a smaller drop, saving off 1μs to bring it down to 15μs.", "The launch of the P5520 also marks the significantly overdue introduction of EDSFF form factors for some of the D7 series drives. Along with the classic U.2 form factor that the drives have used for the last few generations, the P5520 will also be available in the E1.L and E1.S form factors. The latter is new territory for Solidigm, as even in the company’s lower-ender/higher-density D5 product lineup, they’ve only used E1.L previously. The P5520 E1.S drives, in turn, will actually come in two sizes: E1.S 9.5mm and E1.S 15mm. Both will offer the same reduced capacities – 7.68TB max versus double that for U2/E1.L – however the 15mm drive will use that space for a heatsink that the 9.5mm drive lacks the room to fit. Otherwise, the P5620 remains unchanged, and will only come in the U.2 form factor.", "Wrapping things up, according to Solidigm the drives are already in mass production, and are even deployed with some OEMs and cloud providers."]},

Though with prices topping out at $260 for the 2TB model, it would seem that SK hynix has even greater ambition than before, placing the P41 squarely in the high-end segment of the SSD market.", "While SK hynix has been well-established name in the NAND and OEM SSD markets for years, their presence in the consumer retail market is much more recent. The company only kicked off their (contemporary) retail SSD efforts back in August of 2020, with the ", ". But in a single generation and with just a single product, SK hynix was able to carve out a place in the market based on the strength of their initial P31 drives. With solid performance and amazing power efficiency, the P31 made for a very popular PCIe 3 SSD, especially for aftermarket laptop upgrades. And now SK hynix gets to try to improve on that for the PCIe 4 generation with the Platinum P41.", "Taking things from the top, the Platinum P41 SSD is the direct follow-up to the P31. By employing an updated controller (Aries) and their latest-generation 176-layer TLC NAND, SK hynix is aiming to duplicate their early success with an even faster NVMe drive. And yet there’s also an element of “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it” to the design of the P41 with respect to its construction and feature set, which is not a bad thing coming from the P31. It’s a bit more than a speedier, PCIe 4.0 version of the venerable P31, but not by too much more.", "At the heart of this newest SSD is SK hynix’s in-house controller, Aries, the company’s first PCIe 4.0 controller. While SK hynix doesn’t offer a detailed breakdown of its specifications, we do know that it implements a multi-core CPU setup. And based on the construction of the drive – as well as what’s known about the company’s 176L TLC NAND – it would appear that this is another 4-channel design. Which, like the P31 before it, is a notable departure from other high-end NVMe SSDs, which are still typically 8-channel designs.", "Paired with Aries is a DRAM buffer, in the usual 1 GB per 1TB of flash ratio. SK hynix is once again using their own in-house DRAM here, once again using LPDDR4 memory. Given how new Aries is, I’m a bit surprised to see that SK hynix isn’t using LPDDR5 here, but at the end of the day unless they have a way to use the additional benefit of LPDDR5, the benefits would be limited.", "On the NAND side of matters, this is the first retail SSD with SK hynix’s 176L TLC 3D NAND. And while SK hynix doesn’t get the honors of being the first out of the gate on this generation with 176L NAND (Micron takes that title), it’s still one of just a handful of drives on the market with what’s essentially the newest generation of NAND.", "Based on disclosures from ", " and other events, it looks like SK hynix’s 176L is very similar to their previous-generation 128L NAND. We’re still looking at 512Gb dies organized into 4 planes, with the company seemingly investing the bulk of their gains into reducing their physical die sizes instead. So SK hynix can fully populate the P41 with just 1TB of NAND, which is reflected in the performance figures. Meanwhile, the I/O interface speed has been cranked up by 50% versus the last generation (to 1.6Gb/sec), though the program throughput of the new NAND is only about 27% faster, at 168MB/sec for a single die.", "Otherwise, given that SK hynix’s 176L NAND doesn’t improve their die capacities at all, it doesn’t come as too much of a surprise that their overall SSD capacities are remaining unchanged versus the P31. That means the lineup starts at 500GB and tops out at 2TB, which is sufficient for most of the market, but not particularly impressive in mid-2022. However this also means that SK hynix has been able to retain their single-sided construction – placing all of the components on the top of the drive – which makes it particularly well suited for cramped laptops and other devices where NAND on the back-side may be undesirable.", "With regards to performance, in many respects the new P41 drives look a lot like a doubled-up P31.  Sequential read speeds are rated for up to 7GB/sec – essentially hitting the PCIe bottleneck – and meanwhile the fully populated drives are rated to write up to 6.5GB/sec. As always, this is against the SLC cache, so speeds after spilling over to TLC will be much slower. SK hynix doesn’t disclose official throughput figures there, but based on the P31’s specs and the faster program throughput of the 176L NAND, we’re likely looking at 2.0-2.1GB/sec for sequential writes. So like other PCIe 4.0 drives, the gap between cached and uncached writes is growing, as PCIe speeds are improving faster than the write speeds of the TLC NAND itself.", "Random IOPS performance is also significantly improved over the previous-generation P31. SK hynix is claiming 1.4M random read IOPS, and an equally blistering 1.3M random write IOPS. These are at high queue depths (QD32), so performance at QD1 will be far more humble – though still in the tens-of-thousands of IOPS range. In that respect, even the partially-populated 500GB model is still rated for a higher IOPS rate than the fastest P31.", "Meanwhile, the write endurance of the drive/NAND remains unchanged from the P31. That means 500 TBW for the 500GB drive, 750 TBW for the 1TB drive, and 1200 TBW for the largest 2TB drive. Which works out to 0.3 drive writes per day for the largest drive, and increasing slightly to nearly 0.5 DWPD for the smallest drive.", "Performance aside, the other major factor in the original P31’s popularity was its power consumption, and that’s going to warrant a close eye with the new P41. At the top end, the official rating for active power consumption is 7.5W, which is 1.2W more than the P31. Given that we never saw the 1TB P31 reach 6.3W, it’s unlikely that the P41 is going to hit 7.5W either. However the power consumption of SSDs – and particularly SSD controllers – has been going up with the shift to PCIe 4.0, and SK hynix is not immune to that. So it will be very interesting to see where the P41 stands, and if they’re able to maintain their high active power efficiency. Meanwhile the idle and deep sleep power consumption figures remain unchanged at under 50mW and under 5mW respectively.", "Beyond peak performance figures, SK hynix doesn’t publish any additional performance data/benchmarks, so it’s hard to say where they officially expect the drive to land versus the competition. However, if their retail pricing reflects their performance expectations, then it would seem SK hynix is aiming for the high-end of market. At ", ", the 2TB P41 is priced to compete with Samsung’s flagship 980 Pro, and it’s a similar story at ", " for the 1TB model and ", " for the 500GB model. This puts the drives at 13¢/GB for the 2TB model, and increasing from there.", "Suffice it to say, these prices are a big step up from P31 pricing, where even when the drive is not on sale (and it frequently is), it is a very reasonably priced drive that’s typically under 10¢/GB. Compared to the P31, the P41 should be significantly faster in all cases, but SK hynix certainly isn’t selling a budget-priced drive here. The flip side is that if SK hynix wants to charge flagship prices, then they’ll need to be sure to deliver flagship performance with the P41. Otherwise they’re likely to have trouble moving this drive in a market with plenty of other options for high-end PCIe 4.0 TLC SSDs.", "In any case, today’s launch means that PC users will have the chance to check out the new drives first-hand. SK hynix has already started sales of the new drives a few hours ahead of today’s embargo, and like the P31, they’re focusing on selling them directly to consumers via their ", ".

Like other NVMe spec updates, version 2.0 comes with a variety of new features and functionality for drives to implement (usually as optional features). But the most significant change—and the reason this is called version 2.0 instead of 1.5—is that the spec has been drastically reorganized to better fit the broad scope of features that NVMe now encompasses. From its humble beginnings as a block storage protocol operating over PCI Express, NVMe has grown to also become one of the most important networked storage protocols, and now also supports storage paradigms that are entirely different from the hard drive-like block storage abstraction originally provided by NVMe.", "Instead of a base specification for typical PCIe SSDs and a separate NVMe over Fabrics spec, version 2.0 is designed to be a more modular specification and has been split into several documents. The base specification now covers both locally-attached devices and NVMeoF, but more abstractly—enough has been moved out of the ", " that it is no longer sufficient to define all of the functionality needed to implement a simple SSD. Real devices will also need to refer to at least one ", " and at least one ", ". For typical consumer SSDs, that means using the PCIe transport spec and the block storage command set. Other transport options currently include networked NVMe over Fabrics using either TCP or RDMA. Other command set options include Zoned Namespace and Key-Value command sets. We already covered ", " when it was approved for inclusion last year. The three standardized command sets (block, zoned, key-value) cover different points along the spectrum from simple SSDs with thin abstractions over the underlying flash, to relatively complicated, smart drives that take on some of the storage management tasks that would have traditionally been handled by software on the host system.", " ", "Many of the new features in NVMe 2.0 are minor extensions to existing functionality, making those features more useful and more broadly usable. For example, partitioning a device's storage into ", " was introduced in NVMe 1.4, but the spec didn't say how those divisions would be created; that configuration would either need to be hard-coded by the drive's firmware, or handled with vendor-specific commands. NVMe 2.0 adds a standard capacity management mechanism for endurance groups and NVM sets to be allocated, and also adds another layer of partitioning (Domains) for the sake of massive NVMeoF storage appliances that needed more tools for slicing up their pool of available storage, or isolating the performance impacts of different users on shared drives or arrays.", "The NVMe spec originally anticipated the possibility of multiple command sets beyond the base block storage command set. But the original mechanism included for supporting multiple command sets is not adequate for today's use cases: a handful of reserved bits in the controller capabilities data structure are not enough to encompass all the possibilities for what today's SSDs might implement. In particular, the new system for handling multiple command sets now makes it possible for different namespaces behind the same controller to support different command sets, rather than requiring all namespaces to support all of the command sets their parent controller supports.", "Zoned and key-value command sets were already on the radar when NVMe 1.4 was completed, and now those technologies have been incorporated into 2.0 with equal status to the original block storage command set. Future command sets such as for computational storage drives are still a work in progress not ready for standardization, but the NVMe spec is now able to more easily incorporate such new developments. NVMe could in principle also add an Open Channel command set that exposes most or all of the raw details of managing NAND flash memory (pages, erase blocks, defect management, etc.), but the general industry consensus is that the zoned storage paradigm strikes a more reasonable balance, and interest in Open Channel SSDs is waning in favor of Zoned Namespaces.", "For enterprise use cases, NVMe inherited Protection Information support from SCSI/SAS—associating some extra information with each logical block, which is used to verify end to end data integrity. NVMe 2.0 extends the existing Protection Information support from supporting 16-bit CRCs to also supporting 32-bit and 64-bit CRCs, allowing for more robust data protection for large-scale storage systems.", "NVMe 2.0 introduces a significant new security feature: command group control, configured using a new Lockdown command. NVMe 1.4 added a namespace write protect capability that allows the host system to put namespaces into a write-protect mode until explicitly unlocked or until the drive is power cycled. NVMe 2.0's Lockdown allows similar control to disallow other commands. This can be used to put a drive in a state where both ordinary reads and writes are allowed, but various admin commands are locked out so the drive's other features cannot be reconfigured. As with the previous write protect feature, this command group control supports setting these restrictions until they are explicitly removed, or until a power cycle.", "For NVMe over Fabrics use cases, NVMe 2.0 clarifies how to handle firmware updates and safe device shutdown in scenarios where the shared storage is accessible through multiple controllers. There's also now explicit support for hard drives. Even though it's unlikely that hard drives will switch anytime soon to natively use PCIe connections instead of SAS or SATA, supporting rotational media means enterprises can unify their storage networking with NVMe over Fabrics and drop older protocols like iSCSI.", "Overall, NVMe 2.0 doesn't bring as much in the way of new functionality as some of the previous updates. In particular, nothing in this update stands out as being relevant to client/consumer SSDs. But the spec reorganization should make it easier to iterate and experiment with new functionality, and the next several years will hopefully see more frequent updates with smaller changes rather than bundling up two or three years of work for big spec updates.", " ", "Related Reading:"]},

The hardware used in the NV1 will fluctuate based on market conditions. Initially, we should see a mix of DRAMless controllers (Phison E13T, SM2263XT) paired with TLC NAND for lower capacities and QLC NAND for at least the highest 2TB capacity.

This article introduces the new 2021 edition of our consumer SSD test suite. It covers the goals and rationale behind the design choices, the hardware and software configurations used, and the details of each benchmark and its purpose. It is our hope that this new test suite will be suitable for the next several years of SSD reviews.", "To start, we need to review a bit about how SSDs work. Anand's classic articles from 2009, such as ", " and ", ", document many of the early challenges SSDs had to overcome on the way to taking over as the mainstream consumer storage technology. More than a decade later, those articles are still valuable background information on how today's SSDs work. All of the fundamental challenges of dealing with NAND flash memory still apply: the inability to make in-place modification to data stored in NAND flash, the disparity between NAND page sizes and erase block sizes, the need for wear leveling and the consequent performance drops when a drive is full are all still relevant. Today's SSDs are much bigger, faster and cheaper, but their controllers and firmware still need to deal with those issues. Today's SSDs also layer on some extra challenges that make their inner workings even more complicated, and require more sophisticated testing to properly assess.", "", "When I started reviewing SSDs for AnandTech in 2015, TLC NAND and NVMe were only beginning to creep into the consumer market: TLC at the low end, and NVMe at the high end. Both have now taken over: MLC has all but disappeared from the market, and NVMe is the default choice for new systems. (In Micron's most recent earnings call, they shared that their client SSD shipments are now over 90% NVMe by number of bits shipped.) The higher performance allowed by PCIe and NVMe rather than SATA make stunning differences in benchmark scores, but the migration to TLC was actually more significant from the perspective of benchmark design. That's because consumer TLC SSDs rely heavily on SLC caching.", "In a drive, the more bits you write to a cell, the more complex (and slower it is). Modern drives run 3 bits-per-cell, known as TLC, and 4 bits per cell, known as QLC. Both of these are slower for writes than 1 bit per cell, or SLC. By treating a portion of the drive cells as one bit per cell, known as 'SLC mode'. this allows the drive to absorb a burst of writes more quickly. This is because programming the voltage of an SLC cell can be done in one step and doesn't require as much precision as when storing multiple bits per cell.", "The downside is that data written to SLC NAND must later be re-written into blocks that are operating as MLC/TLC/QLC, storing multiple bits per cell. This process (often called folding) is usually automatically performed by the drive during idle time, where latency is not important. This freee up the space in the SLC cache for future use. SLC caching is generally not used by enterprise SSDs because it makes performance less predictable and is detrimental to sustained write performance, but for client and consumer SSDs SLC write caching is now nearly universal: essentially all TLC and QLC SSDs use SLC write caching.", "SLC write caching has obvious implications for any benchmark that writes data to the SSD. SLC caches have a limited size, which creates two tiers of performance - one inside the cache, and one outside a cache. Most users with office-like workloads never see the 'outside-the-cache' performance. Any workload or test that writes data continuously at high speed, such as benchmark after benchmark after benchmark, can eventually overflow the cache and experience a performance drop to the lower tier of performance. Real-world consumer workloads almost never write tens or hundreds of GB continuously, especially not at extremely high speeds (ie. faster than gigabit Ethernet) - even recording uncompressed 4k60 video is a bit less than 1.5GB/s, while high-end NVMe SSDs are now offering peak write speeds in excess of 4GB/s. This is important because some SSD benchmarking involves one test followed by another then by another - enabling a more real-world use case, with adequate breaks for the drive to free up the SLC cache during idle, makes the test more relevant to lots of users.", "SLC cache sizes are also variable on many drives, with the available cache size shrinking as the drive fills up. Thus a user with a 75% full SSD might only have 10% of the regular SLC cache size when the drive is empty. Drive vendors are increasingly choosing to configure SSDs to use as much space as possible for the SLC cache. Tests that operate with a mostly-empty drive can exaggerate the benefits of SLC caching as compared to what users experience when they actually use most of their SSD's advertised capacity. QLC SSDs have also introduced another complication to SLC caching, because they don't use the cache just for write operations. A typical TLC SSD will start clearing out the cache almost as soon as host IO activity ceases, trying to make the most of the idle time to prepare for future bursts of writes. By contrast, the more common behavior for QLC SSDs seems to be leaving data in the SLC cache until the cache is nearly full, so that recently-written data can be accessed again with low latency—and perhaps avoiding some unnecessary re-writes for data that turns out to be short-lived.", "NVMe SSDs (and the ", ") have also made temperature a potential concern. M.2 SSDs drawing over 5W at peak can get quite hot, and it is now common for enthusiast-oriented SSDs and desktop motherboards to provide heatsinks for M.2 drives. During ordinary use, thermal throttling is seldom a problem because real workloads can't keep a fast SSD busy continuously, but it is also fairly easy for benchmarks to trigger. The synthetic benchmarks we were using up to about four years ago tested each IO pattern (random read, sequential write, etc.) for three minutes at each queue depth, for 18 minutes of uninterrupted IO per test. That's enough to trigger thermal throttling on any drive that's prone to overheating, and for the write tests to overflow the SLC cache on most drives. That kind of test can be useful for studying how a drive behaves under extreme conditions, but it doesn't say much about how it would perform in normal use.", "Limiting benchmark duration isn't always enough to ensure that a test doesn't go overboard. The huge performance disparities between SATA and PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs mean that a 10-second test that makes sense for a SATA drive could end up forcing a NVMe drive to do more than ten times as much work. For this reason, our synthetic benchmarks put limits on both running time and the amount of data transferred by each test, helping to keep the tests more realistic and more practical.", "There are also a few other important technological differences between high-end and entry-level consumer SSDs beyond just the choice of interface (SATA, PCIe 3.0, PCIe 4.0) and whether the drive is using TLC or QLC NAND flash memory. The next most significant difference is in how drives store and access the metadata used by the Flash Translation Layer (FTL)—information about what physical location is currently being used to store each Logical Block Address (LBA).", "For at least a few years, most SSDs on the market were using the same basic technique, ", ": a big, simple lookup table for translating LBAs into physical memory addresses. Even though consumer SSDs still default to presenting the illusion of 512-byte LBAs for the sake of compatibility with software written for hard drives, most drives use a FTL that operates on 4kB sectors. From that fact, it only takes a little bit of math to derive that the FTL's mapping table needs just under 1GB of space to manage 1TB of NAND flash. This adds cost to a drive, which is important in a market where often the lowest cost operator wins. Including DRAM in that proportion to the amount of flash is still standard practice for high-end SSDs, but new techniques allow the drive to trade performance for that extra DRAM cost.", "Most entry-level SSD controllers no longer have a DRAM interface, or at least are offered in a more compact package that doesn't have the necessary pins exposed. These DRAMless controllers and the SSDs built around them have to manage their FTL without being able to load all of it into memory at once. The controllers commonly have on-die caches with capacity in the megabytes range, and NVMe SSDs also have the option of borrowing some of the CPU's RAM through the Host Memory Buffer (HMB) feature.", "There are two main downsides to SSDs that don't have full-sized DRAM buffers: First, random reads are more likely to require an extra flash read operation to fetch the mapping information before the requested data can be read. Second, drives that cannot keep the entire FTL in memory have a harder time managing wear leveling and garbage collection, so they tend to suffer greater performance drops under write-heavy workloads and when nearly full.", "For our new suite, the nature of the new elements of the SSD market have been taken into account in our testing. While we have been cognizant of all the issues listed above in our previous testing, the need for new tests to indicate why certain design choices affect the performance of the drive, and what it means to end-users is always a critical element that needs updating and examining regularly.", "To illustrate our new SSD test suite, we're using 1TB SSDs from a range of market segments. Some of these we have previously reviewed, but since this is a new test suite this is also a fresh look at all of these drives.

The latest product to reach the shelves is the new range of 870 EVO SSDs, building on a decade-long legacy of SATA SSDs. We have tested the 1 TB and 4 TB models from this new product family.", "Samsung is one of the few companies still putting significant effort into SATA SSDs and releasing new consumer SATA models. As PC OEMs have overwhelmingly switched to using NVMe SSDs in new systems, even on the smaller capacities, the client/consumer SATA SSD market now exists almost entirely for the sake of DIY system builders and aftermarket upgrades on older systems. Most major consumer SSD brands have either stopped updating their SATA models, or decided to quietly update components without the fanfare of a new model release. Then there are companies creating odd-ball models, such as ", ". Either way, we don't get many new consumer SATA SSDs in for review these days.", "(It is worth noting that the enterprise SATA SSD market has seen somewhat more in the way of visible activity, because the longer product lifetimes in that market and the higher profit margins give SATA SSDs more of a long tail of commercial relevance.)", "Despite this market shift, Samsung is still focused on a SATA product line, although even Samsung is showing reduced interest in SATA. It took over six months from the release of the QLC-based ", " for its TLC-based 870 EVO sibling to arrive, and there's still no sign of an MLC-based 870 PRO model (or any other MLC SSDs from Samsung based on anything newer than their 64-layer 3D NAND). Furthermore, the new 870 EVO no longer caters to either mSATA and M.2 SATA form factors, focusing solely on 2.5-inch drives. The mSATA version of the 860 EVO disappeared from the market last year, but the M.2 SATA version is still readily available and has tracked market price trends as much as Samsung's drives ever do. It's a bit of a surprise that they're dropping M.2 SATA this soon given how long Samsung supported mSATA.", "Given the roughly three-year cadence Samsung has set for their SATA SSD updates, the 870 generation may also be the last.", "We are seeing the usual upgrades in the spec table for the 870 EVO compared to the ", ". The controller is now Samsung's MKX, a minor iterative update to the 860's MJX. The NAND flash memory is a more significant jump: the 870 EVO is using Samsung's 128-layer 3D TLC, first seen on the ", ". More specifically, our 1TB and 4TB 870 EVO samples are using the 512Gbit dies that were introduced on the 2TB 980 PRO, a model that arrived much later than the smaller capacities built around 256Gbit dies. The preceding Samsung 860 EVO launched with Samsung's 64L 3D NAND, and they appear to have skipped over their 92L generation with their TLC SATA drives.", "The performance specifications are very similar to the 860 EVO. Almost all of those performance numbers are limited either by the throughput of the SATA interface or the latency of the NAND itself, so most of the performance numbers are the same across the entire capacity range. The 250GB and 500GB models still have significantly lower sequential write speed after the SLC cache runs out, but this time we don't have official numbers on SLC cache sizes (but we have tested that in this review). On the other hand, Samsung continues to be one of the few brands to provide performance specifications for queue depth 1 in addition to the high queue depth ratings.", "Internally, the 870 EVO continues to illustrate just how ridiculously oversized the 2.5 form factor is for modern consumer storage. Even the 4TB model's PCB takes up just a fraction of the internal space, and the 1TB model's even smaller PCB has only a handful of tiny components for the power regulation on its back side—this could have easily been a single-sided board if Samsung wasn't saving space for the extra flash on the 2TB model.", "1TB (Left) vs 4 TB (Right)", "Truth be told, there aren't that many new SATA SSDs on the market. To put this into perspective, the most recent SATA competitor we reviewed, the SK hynix's Gold S31, was launched in 2019.", "Part of this is down to the lack of focus on the SATA market as mentioned above, but also because SSD vendors have taken to silently updating the hardware inside a product line without changing the product number or announcing the change. Their argument is that as long as they can still achieve the same performance listed in the specification sheet, and adhere to the warranty, the customer shouldn't have to worry about what is actually inside the product. ", "We generally disapprove when SSD vendors silently swap out major components without renaming a product, because changing the SSD controller or NAND flash can have a major impact on a drive's performance and power efficiency. Unfortunately, this has long been a common practice for entry-level models, and a few manufacturers have tried it on more upmarket models and been deservedly excoriated when they're caught (eg. ADATA, with the SX8200 Pro).", "However, for mainstream SATA SSDs based on TLC NAND and controllers with DRAM caches, there's a lot less potential downside for consumers when the manufacturer silently upgrades the NAND. The SATA interface imposes such a severe performance bottleneck that it's unlikely new NAND would result in a slower drive. Switching to newer NAND with a higher per-die capacity could adversely affect the smallest models in a product line, but the tendency has been for 120GB models to simply disappear instead of being updated—and they aren't missed. We're disappointed that (for example) Micron's Crucial MX500 is now shipping with at least 96-layer NAND rather than the 64-layer NAND it launched with, and likely with Silicon Motion's SM2259 controller that features improved error correction over the SM2258.", "Newer NAND in existing SATA models is far more likely to bring benefits to consumers. Maximum throughput cannot increase, but latency and performance at lower queue depths can still be improved marginally. Newer NAND also tends to bring power efficiency improvements, which means that upgrading the storage capacity in a laptop that's a few years old shouldn't hurt battery life even though larger drives tend to be more power-hungry.", "The other factor in this is that we recently updated our SSD test suite for 2021, which means re-testing older drives for new performance numbers. In our SSD test suite 2021 article, we prioritized NVMe SSDs, as that is where the market is. We are getting around to retesting the older SATA drives, although these ", "So while we're a bit lacking in SATA review samples that reflect the current state of the market, we do have a diverse selection of entry-level NVMe SSDs that have been pushing into the SATA SSD price bracket. These may not be viable alternatives for some use cases (older systems that don't support NVMe, or data hoarders that need lots of multi-TB drives), but for any reasonably recent consumer system with ordinary storage needs, these NVMe drives are real competitors to SATA SSDs. That's the focus on this review."]},

Every year the conference includes a session on non-volatile memories where most of the NAND flash memory manufacturers share technical details of their latest developments. At the conference we get more information than these companies are usually willing to share in press briefings, and the presentations are usually about technology that will be hitting the market during the coming year.", "At ISSCC 2021 this week, four of the six major 3D NAND flash memory manufacturers are presenting their newest 3D NAND technology. Samsung, SK hynix and Kioxia (+Western Digital) are sharing their latest 3D TLC NAND designs and Intel is presenting their 144-layer 3D QLC NAND. Not participating this year are Micron (who announced their 176L 3D NAND late last year) and Chinese newcomer YMTC.", "Samsung, SK hynix, and Kioxia/WD presented information about their upcoming generations of 3D TLC. ", "Unsurprisingly, it looks likely that Samsung will again be in the lead for performance, with the lowest read latency and fastest write speeds. However, their bit density is still clearly lagging even though they're claiming a 70% jump with this generation. In the past, their lagging density hasn't been as much of a downside as it might appear at first glance, because Samsung has been able to avoid using string stacking and can manufacture a stack of 128 layers as a single deck while their competitors have all had to split their stack into two decks, increasing the number of fab steps required. This might be the generation that brings Samsung's inevitable adoption of string stacking, but if that's the case then their lingering density disadvantage is rather disappointing. On the other hand, if they've managed to put off that transition for one more generation and achieved this kind of density increase only using a combination of other techniques (most notably a CMOS under Array layout), then it's a very impressive advance and it would be safe to say that Samsung is years ahead of the competition when it comes to the high aspect ratio etching of the vertical channels that is the most critical fab step in scaling 3D NAND. We'll know more once Samsung discloses the actual layer count, but they're keeping that secret for now—which hints that they don't expect to have the highest layer count to brag about.", "The TLC parts described by SK hynix and Kioxia/WD look fairly similar, save for the big difference that SK hynix is talking about a 512Gb die and Kioxia is talking about a 1Tb die. Both designs look to have similar performance and density, though Kioxia is touting a higher NAND interface speed. Kioxia and Western Digital have put out a press release announcing 162-layer 3D NAND, so they're a bit behind SK hynix and Micron for total layer count. That press release also mentions a 10% improvement in the horizontal density of their cell array, so Kioxia and Western Digital are probably packing the vertical channels closer together than any of their competitors.", "The only company with updates this year on QLC is Intel.", "In general, Intel has been more focused on QLC NAND than any of its competitors. This 144L QLC is the first generation of 3D NAND Intel hasn't co-developed with Micron, and it is unique in several respects. Intel is taking its 3D NAND technology in different directions from the rest of the industry will have interesting ramifications for their agreement to sell the NAND flash business to SK hynix, but in the short term it seems like Intel is getting the NAND they want to be selling. With only 144 layers, Intel is almost certainly now in the last place for total layer count. Compared to 9x-layer QLC, Intel has much better performance and density—but QLC versions of the new TLC described by SK hynix and Kioxia should have comparable density. Intel has backed off from the frankly astronomical erase block size their 96L QLC used, but the 48MB block size of their new 144L QLC still seems a bit high.", "This change saves a big chunk of die space and allows for over 90% of the die area to be used for the memory cell array. SK hynix was next to make this switch, which they call Periphery under Cell (PuC). The rest of the manufacturers are now also onboard: Kioxia (then Toshiba) and Western Digital presented a 128-layer CuA design at ISSCC 2019 but their fifth generation BiCS 3D NAND ended up going into production as a 112L design without CuA. Their ISSCC presentation this year is for a 170+ layer design with CuA, and they've put out a press release confirming that their sixth generation BiCS 3D NAND will be a 162-layer design with CuA.", "Aside from saving die space, a CuA/PuC style design for 3D NAND allows for a die to include more peripheral circuitry than would otherwise be cost-effective. This makes it practical to divide a die's memory array into more separate planes, each with their own copies of much of the peripheral circuitry. Most 3D NAND that has been built without a CuA layout has used just two planes per die, but now that everyone is using CuA the standard is four planes per die. This provides extra parallelism that increases the performance per die and offsets the overall SSD performance drop that usually comes from using fewer dies to reach the same total capacity.", "A CuA structure is not without its challenges and downsides. When a manufacturer first switches to CuA they get a big increase in available die space for peripheral circuitry. But after that, each successive generation that adds layers means there's less die space available for managing the same number of memory cells, so peripheral circuitry still has to shrink. Putting peripheral circuitry under the memory cell array also introduces new constraints. For example, Samsung's ISSCC presentation this year mentions the challenges of constructing large capacitors for the charge pumps when they can no longer use the tall metal structures that are simple to include alongside the 3D NAND stack.", "Dividing a NAND flash die into four planes allows for the die to handle more operations in parallel, but doesn't make it behave quite like four independent dies. There are restrictions on what can be done in parallel: for example, simultaneous writes still have to go to the same word line within each plane. But as the number of planes in a flash die grows, manufacturers have been working to loosen some of those restrictions. In previous years, manufacturers have introduced *independent* multi-plane reads, meaning simultaneous reads in different planes don't have any restrictions on the locations within each plane that are being read—a big win for random read throughput.", "Now, another restriction on multi-plane operations is being relaxed: the timing of read operations in different planes doesn't need to line up. This makes it possible for one plane to perform multiple reads from SLC pages while another plane is performing a single slower read from TLC or QLC pages. This capability is called Asynchronous Independent (Multi-)Plane Read. The practical effect is that for read operations, a large 4-plane die can now match the performance of four smaller 1-plane dies. This mitigates many of the performance downsides that higher per-die capacity brings to SSDs that only have one or two dies per channel.", "Kioxia and WD reported that implementing this capability required them to stop sharing charge pumps between planes, in order to avoid poorly-timed voltage and current fluctuations that would have resulted from unsynchronized read operations. Intel is also halfway to this capability with their 4-plane 144L QLC: planes are paired up into plane groups, and each plane group can perform reads without needing to align with the timing of reads in the other plane group.", " ", "The new TLC NAND parts described at ISSCC support IO speeds ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 Gb/s for communication between the NAND flash dies and the SSD controller. The fastest NAND in SSDs currently on the market runs at 1.2-1.4Gb/s. The NAND manufacturers can benefit from vertical integration by ensuring that their own SSD controller designs used for their own SSDs will be ready to support these higher IO speeds, but other SSD vendors that rely on third-party controllers may be left behind. Phison's latest E18 8-channel controller for high-end PCIe 4.0 SSDs only supports 1.2Gb/s IO speeds, and their upcoming E21T 4-channel NVMe controller supports 1.6Gb/s. Silicon Motion's 8-channel SM2264 and 4-channel SM2267 support 1.6Gb/s and 1.2Gb/s IO speeds respectively.", "Since 8 channels running at 1.2Gb/s is already enough for a SSD to saturate a PCIe 4.0 x4 connection, these new higher IO speeds will not be of much use to high-end SSDs until PCIe 5.0 arrives. But more affordable 4-channel consumer SSD controllers will be able to use these higher speeds to move up well into PCIe 4.0 performance territory, matching or exceeding the throughput that the first PCIe 4.0 SSD controller (Phison E16, 8ch @ 800Mb/s) offered. As demonstrated by drives like the SK hynix Gold P31, an advanced 4-channel controller supporting high IO speeds on each channel can be very competitive on performance while operating with far higher power efficiency than 8-channel controllers.", "Hitting these higher IO speeds requires major upgrades to the interface logic on the NAND dies, and as we've seen with other high-speed interfaces like PCI Express, increasing power consumption is a major concern. Samsung is addressing this by using dual-mode drivers and termination. When higher drive strength is needed because of more load on the bus (from more dies per channel), the'll use a PMOS transistor for pull-up, and otherwise they can use a NMOS transistor and cut the power consumption of the driver by more than half. This gives Samsung a single interface design that will work well for both small consumer SSDs and large enterprise drives with many more dies per channel. (In the past Samsung has added separate retimer dies to multi-chip packages that stack lots of NAND dies together on the same one or two channels. We're not sure if Samsung is still using this technique.)", " ", "String stacking has been viewed as something of a necessary evil for scaling up 3D NAND to higher layer counts. Only Samsung has managed to build more than 100 layers of 3D NAND at a time, and everyone else has long since switched to stacking two decks each with a more reasonable layer count. This means that eg. Micron's 176-layer 3D NAND is built as 88 layers of memory cells, then another 88 layers are constructed on top. This drives up cost compared to doing all the layers at once, and it requires careful alignment at the interface between decks. But the alternative would be to make the vertical channels much wider, so that the aspect ratio (width vs depth) would stay within the realm of what can be feasibly etched by current fab techniques.", "Intel's 144L QLC design includes the surprise that they are already moving to a 3-deck stack: 48+48+48 layers rather than the 72+72 we would expect. Since their previous generation is a 48+48 layer (96L total) design, it's possible that they have changed very little about how the memory array itself is fabricated aside from repeating the same sequence of deposition, etch and fill steps a third time. Intel is taking a hit on fab throughput with this approach, but it probably helps them better control the variation in channel and cell dimensions from the top to bottom of the stack, which may be more of a concern given their focus on QLC and their unique decision to still use a floating gate memory cell rather than switching to a charge trap cell like everyone else.", "To go along with this triple-deck structure, Intel has reorganized how they handle erase blocks, and now each of the three decks constitutes a separate collection of erase blocks. That means the middle third of a 144L string can now be erased without interfering with the data stored in the other two thirds of the string. Dividing blocks by decks is also how Intel was able to reduce the 96 MB block size with their 96L QLC down to a less extreme 48MB block size.", " ", "It's important to understand that ISSCC, where these updates are presented, is an academic conference. The presentations are not product announcements and the papers are not product spec sheets. The designs presented at ISSCC don't always match what goes into mass production. For example, Kioxia/WD in the past have presented designs for 128L and 170+ layer NAND, but their actual fifth and sixth generation BiCS NAND as mass produced are 112L and 162L designs. They also, despite mentioning it in their 2019 talk, deferred a switch to a more dense 'CMOS under Array (CuA) structure' to a later product line.  Specifications such as write performance are also often presented as best-case, and real world products end up being a notch below what is presented.", "Despite the coming together of all these companies under one conference, even when the presentation does match the eventual product, what we learn from ISSCC is usually imperfect and incomplete information. The companies are inconsistent about what metrics they report, and we usually get information for only one die design per generation—a company might present their 512Gbit design even if they're planning to manufacture both 512Gbit and 256Gbit parts. In recent years several companies seem to be alternating between talking about their QLC one year and TLC the next. In spite of all of that, ISSCC presentations on 3D NAND are still a great way to gauge how the state of the art has progressed and where the industry as a whole is headed.", "About half the content of these presentations is clever schemes for micromanaging voltages applied to various wires to optimize the read, program and erase processes. There are complex tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, wear and other factors. we're not going to dig into all of these details, other than to say that programming a cell to the desired voltage (and without disturbing other cells) is not a simple process, and even reading from a TLC or QLC cell is quite a bit more complicated than reading from a DRAM or SRAM cell. We're more interested in any major structural changes in the dies themselves, and the end results of all the finessing of voltages: the speeds at which a page of memory can be read or programmed."]},

The new 670p is the biggest update yet, bringing not only the next generation of QLC NAND, but also a major upgrade to the SSD controller. The Intel SSD 670p is launching today as a retail product, and will be used by major PC OEMs starting in April. Based on the pricing, it looks like Intel is solely targeting OEMs with this device. ", " Prices have been slashed just one day after launch, to very reasonable levels for a newly-launched retail product.", "As a brief refresher, the first consumer QLC SSD was the ", ", launched in 2018 and based on their 64-layer 3D QLC and the Silicon Motion SM2263 controller. This drive (and the similar ", ") proved that QLC NAND was a viable choice for entry-level consumer NVMe SSDs. Since then, that market segment has been largely divided between DRAMless TLC drives that are preferable at lower capacities, and QLC SSDs with DRAM caches that are competitive at and above 1TB.", "In late 2019, Intel ", ". This upgraded to 96L QLC to provide slightly improved performance and endurance. The 512GB capacity was dropped and the firmware was tweaked to allow for larger SLC cache sizes on partially-filled drives. The 665p turned out to be a pretty short-lived drive: Intel announced in August 2020 that the 665p would be discontinued with a last-order date at the end of January 2021. Meanwhile, the 660p is still on the market.", "Bringing us to the present, the new Intel 670p is rolling out with Intel's latest QLC NAND as well as a much-needed update to the SSD controller. Because the 665p is already off the market, Intel's marketing materials for the 670p take the unusual approach of comparing the 670p against the earlier 660p and largely ignoring the existence of the 665p, allowing Intel to slightly overstate the generational improvements and re-announce some advances (such as the larger SLC caches) that were already introduced by the 665p. The 670p brings back the 512GB capacity (ill-advised as it may be) and appears to be intended as a more complete replacement for the 660p.", "The 670p is PCIe 3.0 x4 drive, desite it being new to market. This is because it reimagines Intel's positioning in the budget NVMe market, and going to something faster is seen as a premium play today.", "As we ", ", Intel's new 144L QLC NAND is a considerable improvement over their 96-layer generation. Aside from the density increase, it brings slightly lower read latencies, more significant improvements to write latency and throughput, and a few other features to improve performance. The density increase should help further reduce costs, but Intel has fallen behind the rest of the industry in the layer-count race and had to adopt triple-deck string stacking in order to reach 144 layers, so their cost savings won't be as significant as competitors who should be able to reach similar QLC densities with their double-deck designs of 162-176 layers.", "The new 144L QLC has also enabled Intel to increase their write endurance ratings again. The 670p's write endurance is 23% higher than the 665p and 85% higher than the 660p, at roughly 370 write cycles. Which spread out over 5 years, works out to 0.2 drive writes per day (DWPD). More importantly, at 0.2 DWPD Intel's QLC SSDs aren't that far behind the 0.3 DWPD that most consumer TLC SSDs are rated for.", "While the new NAND in the 670p certainly helps, it owes most of its improved performance to the upgraded SSD controller. The SM2263 controller used in the 660p and 665p is a low-cost 4-channel controller, appropriate for the entry-level market segment but seriously outdated. In particular, it is limited to IO speeds of 667 MT/s between the controller and the flash, which means that even with the fastest flash it cannot come close to saturating the PCIe 3.0 x4 host interface and struggles to go beyond about 2.4GB/s.", "For the 670p, Intel has switched to the Silicon Motion SM2265. This controller hasn't been officially announced or documented by Silicon Motion, but a few references to it have popped up previously (though half of them are typos of the SM2256 SATA SSD controller). During the press briefing Q&A for the 670p, Intel stated the controller was a SM2262—the 8-channel controller from the same generation as the SM2263. So it's possible that the SM2265 is a more compact packaging of an SM2262 variant, much like the Phison E12S that's now used on many drives to make room for four NAND packages on the top side of the M.2 PCB.", "Also possible is that the SM2265 may be more closely related to the SM2264 and SM2267 PCIe 4.0 controllers. The SM2267 is a four-channel controller and one of the first shipping PCIe 4.0 SSD controllers that is aimed at mainstream market segments rather than the high end. The package size for the SM2265 is the same as the SM2263 and SM2267 which suggests it's a four-channel controller (though the SM2267 actually has a higher pin count than the SM2262), and the performance means it would have to be supporting a higher IO speed on those four channels: closer to the SM2267's 1.2 GT/s rather than the 667 MT/s supported by the SM2263. In terms of features, the SM2265 seems to be a better fit with the SM2262/2263 generation: PCIe 3.0 instead of PCIe 4.0 and 8 queues instead of 15. The SM2265 may have inherited the upgraded error correction capabilities that Silicon Motion developed for the SM2264/2267 generation to better support QLC NAND. Overall, the SM2265 appears to be a mix of old and new, producing an updated low-cost controller that's better-suited to the remaining use cases for PCIe 3.0.", "The layout of the Intel 670p is a lot less crowded than the 660p/665p: they're now using only two NAND packages to reach 2TB rather than four packages. Since the new 144L QLC is still manufactured with the same 1Tbit capacity per die, Intel's simply stacking more dies in each package. With this layout, Intel could have easily fit a controller the size of the 8-channel SM2262, but for the upcoming Optane Memory H20 they'll need to fit all these components into half the space to make room for the Optane half of that device.", " ", "Aside from test results for the earlier Intel SSD 660p, this review includes results from the following competing products:", " "]},

But for now, we know their first 176L parts are 512Gbit TLC dies, built using string stacking of two 88-layer decks—Micron would seem to now be in second place behind Samsung for how many layers of NAND flash memory cells they can fabricate at a time, and clearly in first place for the total number of layers on a die.", "The switch to a replacement gate/charge trap cell design seems to have enabled a significant reduction in layer thickness: the 176L dies are 45µm thick, about the same total thickness as Micron's 64L floating-gate 3D NAND. A 16-die stacked package comes in at less than 1.5mm thick, suitable for most mobile and memory card use cases. As with previous generations of Micron 3D NAND, the chip's peripheral logic is mostly fabricated under the NAND memory cell stacks, a technology Micron calls CMOS under Array (CuA). This has repeatedly helped Micron deliver some of the smallest die sizes, and Micron estimates their 176L 512Gbit die is about 30% smaller than the best their competitors currently offer.", "The 176L NAND supports an interface speed of 1600MT/s, up from 1200MT/s for their 96L and 128L flash. Read and write (program) latency are both improved by over 35% compared to their 96L NAND, or by over 25% compared to their 128L NAND.  Micron cites an overall mixed workload improvement of about 15% for compared to their UFS 3.1 modules using 96L NAND.", "Micron's 176L 3D NAND has already started volume production and is shipping in some Crucial-branded consumer SSD products. However, Micron hasn't specified which specific Crucial products are now using 176L NAND (or their 128L NAND, for that matter), so we expect that this is a fairly low-volume release for now. Still, over the next year we should 176L NAND production ramp up to higher volumes than their 128L process ever reached, and we can expect a wide range of products based on this 176L NAND to be released and replace most of what's using their 96L NAND."]},

We covered ", " earlier this year after the extension to the NVMe standard was ratified. Western Digital has been one of the strongest proponents of ZNS, so it's no surprise that they're one of the first to launch a zoned SSD product.", "The ZN540 is based on a similar hardware platform to their existing traditional enterprise/datacenter SSDs like the ", ". The ZN540 is a 2.5 U.2 SSD using 3D TLC NAND and a Western Digital-designed SSD controller, and offers capacities up to 8TB with dual-port PCIe 3.0 support. The most significant hardware difference is a big decrease in the amount of RAM the SSD needs compared to the usual 1GB per 1TB ratio; Western Digital isn't ready to disclose exactly how much RAM they are shipping in the ZN540, but it should be a nice decrease in BOM.", "The new ZN540 also renders the Ultrastar DC SN340 mostly obsolete. The SN340 was designed to get some of the benefits of a zoned SSD by using a Flash Translation Layer that works with 32kB blocks instead of the usual 4kB. That enables a DRAM reduction by a factor of eight, at the expense of much lower random write performance, especially for small block sizes. ZNS SSDs simply prohibit random writes in the first place rather than silently deliver horrible performance with extremely high write amplification, and the ZNS interface allows software to be properly informed of these limitations and provides tools to cope with them.", "The Ultrastar DC ZN540 is currently sampling to major customers. Software support for ZNS SSDs is fairly mature at the OS level in the Linux kernel and related tooling. Application-level support for zoned storage is more of a work in progress, but Western Digital and others have been hard at work.

Western Digital and Kioxia announced their 112-layer fifth-generation BiCS 3D NAND in January 2020, but the new WD drives announced today are still using 96-layer TLC. We did catch a few potential references to future generations of 3D NAND: they have above 100 layers in production now and will reach 200 layers pretty soon, they'll be moving the peripheral circuits to be above and below the memory rather than alongside (following in the footsteps of Micron, Intel and Hynix), 2Tbit dies will be coming at some point, and I/O speeds going from 400MT/s to 2GT/s over four generations.

{"title": "IBM at FMS 2020: Beating TLC With QLC, MRAM And Computational Storage", "paragraph": ["Two years ago we reported on ", ", their custom U.2 NVMe SSD for use in their FlashSystem enterprise storage appliances. Earlier this year IBM released the FlashCore Module 2 and this week they detailed it in a keynote presentation at Flash Memory Summit. Like its predecessor, the FCM 2 is a very high-end enterprise SSD with some unusual and surprising design choices.", "The most unusual feature of the first IBM FlashCore Module was the fact that it did not use any supercapacitors for power loss protection, nor did the host system include battery backup. Instead, IBM included Everspin's magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) to provide an inherently non-volatile write cache. The FCM 2 continues to use MRAM, now upgraded from Everspin's 256Mbit ST-DDR3 to their 1Gbit ST-DDR4 memory. The higher-density MRAM makes it much easier to include a useful quantity on the drive, but it's still far too expensive to entirely replace DRAM on the SSD: managing the FCM2's multi-TB capacities require several GB of RAM. IBM's main motivation for using MRAM as a write buffer instead of DRAM with power loss protection is that supercaps or batteries tend to have service lifespans of only a few years, and when an energy storage system fails things can get ugly. IBM sees MRAM as offering better long-term reliability that is worth the cost and complexity of building a drive with three kinds of memory.", "The FCM 1 used Micron 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, which at the time was a pretty standard choice for high-end enterprise SSDs. The FCM 2 makes the bold switch to using Micron's 96L 3D QLC NAND. The higher density and lower cost per bit has enabled them to double the maximum drive capacity up to 38.4 TB, but maintaining performance while using inherently slower flash is a tall order. Fundamentally, the new NAND has about three times the program (write) latency and 2-3 times the read latency. Write endurance and data retention are also lower. But the FCM 2 is still rated for 2 DWPD and IBM claims increased performance thanks to a combination of several tricks.", "IBM's FlashCore Modules use a custom SSD controller architecture implemented on a massive FPGA. The 20-channel NAND interface explains the slightly odd drive capacities compared to more run of the mill SSDs with 8 or 16 channel controllers. IBM includes line-rate transparent compression derived from the hardware compression provided on IBM Z mainframes. This provides a compression ratio around 2.3x on typical data sets, which goes a long way toward mitigating the endurance issues with QLC (but the FCM 1 also had compression, so this isn't a big advantage for the FCM 2). The FCM 2 also can use some of its QLC NAND as SLC. This isn't as simple as the SLC write caches found on virtually all consumer SSDs. Instead, the FCM 2 tracks IO patterns to predict which chunks of data will be frequently accessed (hot data), and tries to store those on SLC instead of QLC while sending cold data straight to QLC. Enterprise SSDs typically avoid using SLC caching because it makes it hard to ensure good QoS during sustained workloads. (Client drives can count on real-world workloads offering plenty of idle time that can be used for cache flushing.) IBM seems confident that their smart data placement heuristics can avoid any serious QoS issues, and the FCM 2 drive can also make use of data lifetime hints provided by host software.", "Using the FCM 2 drives, IBB's FlashSystem storage appliances can offer 40GB/s per 2U/24 drive system, with usable capacities of up to 757 TB or an effective capacity of about 1.73 PB thanks to the built-in compression."]},

These cards are primarily aimed at the workstation market, as the server market has largely moved on from traditional RAID arrays, especially when using NVMe SSDs for which traditional hardware RAID controllers do not exist. HighPoint's PCIe gen4 lineup currently consists of cards with four or eight M.2 slots, and one with eight SFF-8654 ports for connecting to U.2 SSDs. They also recently added an 8x M.2 card to their PCIe gen3 family, with the Mac Pro specifically in mind as a popular workstation platform that won't be getting PCIe gen4 support particularly soon.", "HighPoint's NVMe RAID is implemented as software RAID bundled with adapter cards featuring Broadcom/PLX PCIe switches. HighPoint provides RAID drivers and management utilities for Windows, macOS and Linux. Competing software NVMe RAID solutions like Intel RST or VROC achieve boot support by bundling a UEFI driver in with the rest of the motherboard's firmware. Highpoint's recent 4-drive cards include their UEFI driver on an Option ROM to provide boot support for Windows and Linux systems, and all of their cards allow booting from an SSD that is not part of a RAID array. HighPoint's NVMe RAID supports RAID 0/1/10 modes, but does not implement any parity RAID options.", "Highpoint has also improved the cooling on their RAID cards. Putting several high-performance M.2 SSDs and a power-hungry PCIe switch on one card generally requires active cooling, and HighPoint's early NVMe RAID cards could be pretty noisy. Their newer heatsink design lets the cards benefit from airflow provided by case fans instead of just the card's own fan (two fans, for the 8x M.2 cards), and the fans they are now using are a bit larger and quieter.", "In the PCIe 2.0 era, PLX PCIe switches were common on high-end consumer motherboards to provide multi-GPU connectivity. In the PCIe 3.0 era, the switches were priced for the server market and almost completely disappeared from consumer/enthusiast products. In the PCIe 4.0 era, it looks like prices have gone up again. Even though these cards are the best way to get lots of M.2 PCIe SSDs connected to mainstream consumer platforms that don't support the PCIe port bifurcation required by passive quad M.2 riser boards, the pricing makes it very unlikely that they'll ever see much use in systems less high-end than a Threadripper or Xeon workstation.

For tasks like audio and video editing workstations, that's an impressive amount of local storage capacity and throughput. The lower write endurance of consumer SSDs (even QLC drives) is generally less of a concern for workstations than for servers that are busy around the clock, and for many use cases having a capacity of tens of TB means the array as a whole has plenty of write endurance even if the individual drives have low DWPD ratings. Using consumer SSDs also means that peak performance is higher than for many enterprise SSDs, and a large RAID-0 array of consumer SSDs will have a total SLC cache size in the TB range.", "The SSD7140 (8x M.2, PCIe gen3) and the SSD7505 (4x M.2, PCIe gen4) have already hit the market and the SSD7540 (8x M.2, PCIe gen4) is shipping this month.

The EDSFF form factor options are gaining traction in several markets, and lessons learned by early adopters are still driving tweaks to the specifications. The myriad variations under the EDSFF umbrella have not been simplified much, but at least the brief format war between the EDSFF E1.S form factor and Samsung's NF1 has concluded, with Samsung now supporting and contributing to the E1.S standard. As EDSFF adoption increases, we'll probably see several variants fall into irrelevance, as happened to some of the less popular M.2 card sizes. But even once it's clear which members of the EDSFF family are succeeding in the market, the less popular options will probably remain part of the standards documents.", "The EDSFF flavors all share a common connector standard, which originated as the Gen-Z Scalable Connector Standard and has been adopted by several other standards. The Gen-Z connector provides much higher density than traditional PCIe slots, supplies the 12V power that M.2 lacks, and is relatively future-proof by offering adequate signal integrity for future versions of PCIe. The EDSFF standards define three sizes of the connector and pinouts for PCIe x4, x8 and x16 links.", "The EDSFF form factors come in two heights: sized for 1U servers are E1.S and E1.L, the short and long derivatives of the Intel Ruler concept. For 2U servers, the E3 sizes are similar to the existing 2.5 drive form factor.", " ", "The most significant changes in the past year were to the E3 form factors. Earlier this month version 2.0 of the E3 form factor spec was published, breaking backwards compatibility with version 1.0 from 2018. The motivation for the incompatible changes came from the Open Compute Project (OCP) NIC 3.0 specification, which has similar dimensions but uses a new variant of the Gen-Z connector: OCP added a fourth tab with 28 extra contacts to carry various sideband signals not included in the 4c (x16) version of the connector. The E3.S form factor was stretched a bit to match the dimensions of the OCP NIC 3.0 standard, and the connector location was moved to be compatible with the OCP NIC 3.0. With the new version of the EDSFF E3 spec, it's now possible for servers to provide slots that can fulfill either role.", "The E3 form factors are the most capable and flexible in the EDSFF. They support up to PCIe x16 connections, though most SSDs will continue to stick with just x4. The E3.L 2T offers similar physical volume and TDP to a half-height half-length PCIe add-in card. The E3.S in two thicknesses is slightly larger than the two common thicknesses for U.2/U.3 SSDs, but E3.S offers better cooling and the possibility of more PCIe lanes. The newly stretched E3.S is also now large enough that an E1.S PCB can be mounted inside an E3.S case, providing a quick and easy path for compatibility between the two heights.", "When the EDSFF family launched, most of the early attention was focused on the E1.S and E1.L form factors because they addressed the most pressing needs of hyperscale datacenters. The E3 form factors are more attractive for traditional enterprise servers, which take longer to adopt changes like this. Dell and HPE are the leading proponents of this part of the EDSFF family. Since the E3 standard was just rebooted with an incompatible change, we're now looking at E3 version 2.0 products hitting the market around the first half of 2022.", "Servers using E3 form factors are likely to use more than one version, such as providing a dozen or more thin slots for SSDs, plus several of the thicker 2T slots for NICs, accelerators, and higher-power SSDs (eg. based on 3D XPoint or some other storage class memory). While they are primarily intended for 2U systems, the E3 form factors can be used in 1U servers, but have some cooling and density disadvantages relative to E1.S for 1U systems.", " ", " ", "The E1.S family has now grown to include five different thickness options. However, the standards for a bare PCB or one with just a heatspreader are not getting much attention. The three (formerly two) versions with a full enclosure seem to be the most popular. These can slide directly into a hot-swap bay without needing to be screwed into a tray or caddy. At the front of the drive is a flange with two screw holes which are used to attach an appropriate latching mechanism for whatever server chassis the drives will be installed into. Samsung has recently proposed modifying this with a few extra cutouts to enable a screw-less version of their latching mechanism, which will be quicker to install.", "This year's addition to the E1.S standard was a new intermediate thickness heatsink option proposed by Microsoft and intended for their Azure datacenters. Microsoft found that the 9.5mm symmetric enclosure didn't offer quite enough cooling for the kind of drive TDPs they're expecting for PCIe Gen4 SSDs (at least, within the bounds of reasonable fan speeds), but the 25mm asymmetric enclosure/heatsink sacrifices a bit too much density and has excess thermal headroom that Microsoft doesn't need for their primary storage drives. As a result, there's now also a 15mm version standardized and already being deployed at scale.", "The 9.5mm-thick enclosure option was already sufficient to kill off server M.2 drives except for boot drive usage: it offers the hot-swap capability and 12V power that M.2 lacks, and can be deployed with similar density. The newer 15mm thick heatsink version of E1.S may end up being more popular, but it's a bit too new to judge how much traction it will get beyond the original proponents. Compared to 2.5/15mm U.2 SSDs, the E1.S 15mm form factor is still a significant improvement: four E1.S 15mm drives can fit in the space of two 15mm U.2 drives, and the E1.S drives are still easier to cool. Storage-focused systems can achieve higher density with the 9.5mm option, but the E1.L form factors offer even higher storage density.", "The 25mm heatsink E1.S option now seems likely to be the least popular of the three enclosure choices. It still has a niche for squeezing high-power accelerators into 1U systems, but PCB width can be a limiting factor and the E3 form factors can also accommodate big, high-power chips. Any E1.S slot providing 8 instead of just 4 PCIe lanes is likely to use at least the 15mm heatsink option, because an accelerator capable of using that much bandwidth will need the extra cooling.", "All of the E1.S variants use the same PCB and vary only in the metal enclosure and height of the heatsink (if any), so there's not much burden on SSD vendors to support all three of the 9.5mm, 15mm and 25mm. Server vendors face the tougher choice of deciding how wide to make their slots; narrower drives can be mounted in wider slots, but this may lead to unbalanced airflow—though not as bad as leaving a slot empty without a placeholder inserted. The most common configuration for general-purpose 1U servers might end up being a bank of E1.S slots for storage plus one or two E3.S/OCP NIC slots—this seems especially likely if the OCP approach of putting all IO at the front of the server catches on outside of hyperscale datacenters.", " ", "There have been no recent changes to the E1.L form factor. This one remains the closest to Intel's original Ruler concept. It is much longer than any other drive form factor, so the entire server layout must be designed around E1.L. This form factor will be used almost exclusively in systems designed for the sole purpose of containing a lot of flash memory, and will not see any significant adoption for general-purpose or compute-oriented servers. E1.L is suitable for drives with capacities of tens of TB each.", "While not formally part of the EDSFF specifications, the ", " has developed the OCP NVMe Cloud SSD specification. This is a unification of most of Microsoft and Facebook's requirements for their SSDs, covering areas like the optional NVMe features, telemetry capabilities, endurance and performance that those companies want. The Cloud SSD specification applies to M.2 22110, E1.S and E1.L form factors. Several SSD vendors are already targeting this specification, which will help cut down on the amount of firmware customization required by different customers.", " "]},

Following on from the success of the 100 TB ExaDrive DC, the company is releasing a new ExaDrive NL series, from 16 TB to 64 TB. This new series uses enterprise grade QLC, compared to TLC in the DC variant, to provide a more cost effective solution with endurance designed to eclipses any other QLC drive on the market.", "For most enterprise storage needs, tiered storage has become the norm. For random access workloads with high bandwidth requirements, NVMe storage or DRAM-like alternatives are preferred, while on the other end where capacity is king, large mechanical hard drives based on SATA or SAS take center stage, with up to ninety 18 TB drives in a single 4U operating as ‘Nearline’ storage as a data retrieval tier or cold storage. There are a number of companies designing controllers, flash, new platter technology, and all between in order to offers something either at the extremes of these storage needs, or to create new caching tiers in the middle. The idea is to trade off latency, bandwidth and price, for capacity as we move up from those bulky spinning rust things.", "This leads us to Nimbus Data. The company started offering flash storage solutions for the enterprise as early as 2003, before flash storage was really a thing – at the time the products were small but offered amazing performance over hard drives, and it was several years before other companies started producing similar products for the market. The company has been profitable for years, never relying on any venture capital or seed funding, and has over 200+ customers, including big names over the years such as eBay, Paypal, and Apple. There are also two big CDNs in the mix, which unfortunately they can’t disclose, but these are the sorts of customers that Nimbus Data is courting with its ExaDrive product range.", "Two years ago, ", ", a 100 TB 3.5-inch drive designed for like-for-like swap for the 14-18 TB drives that populated most of the nearline storage options on the market. The problem as always with NAND flash is that cost per TB is higher than mechanical storage, but the DC was aimed to offer much greater density and better power consumption in the same chassis. The ExaDrive DC internally has four separate PCBs, each with a custom flash controller with firmware written by Nimbus Data to manage the status of the flash cells. These are grouped into a backplane inside the 3.5-inch chassis, where an FPGA does overall management and monitoring of the drive. The drive comes with SAS 2.0 and SATA 3.0 6 Gbps interfaces, and the size of the drive combined with the speed of the interface means that Nimbus Data has been offering the drive with an unlimited endurance warranty for five years. Writing sequential data to this drive, at around 400 MBps, would take 70 hours for context.", "", "These drives were priced in the region of $40,000 a piece, however the goal was to be able to replace what could be 20U of 540+ mechanical hard drives, around 8 PB of storage, with one 4U with 9 PB. The metrics that Nimbus Data’s customers cared about were centered around density, better latency, endurance (mechanical hard drives are often rated at 550 TB/year, which is actually a limit on the motor, not the platter), power per TB, and ultimately operational expenses over the lifetime of the server (OpEx), including rack space, power, cooling, and maintenance. The drives were expensive for not only being new on the market, but they also used TLC NAND, as it was easy to come by at the time. Some of Nimbus Data’s customers loved the product, but requested if a cheaper version was possible. Enter the ExaDrive NL.", "The ExaDrive NL is almost an identical product to the DC variants, except instead of using TLC NAND, this product uses QLC NAND. This allows the amount of NAND to be used to drop, saving some expense.", "The main criticism for QLC NAND is that it is rated at a lower endurance than TLC NAND, at users who deploy QLC at an enterprise level at scale might be put off by this property. Nimbus Data tells us that going into this project, they understood why this was a concern for its customers. As a result, they are using some of the best enterprise-grade QLC available on the market, which I’m told is rated for 1500 P/E cycles minimum.", "Also to that, Nimbus Data says that competing products in this space that use QLC often come up across controller limitations when growing in size. Modern NAND controllers can only reliably address 4-16 TB of NAND, and so going beyond that requires adjusting the block size which increases write amplification, reducing the effective endurance of the NAND and lifetime of the drive. It also increases the load on the controller, causing extra power consumption. Due to the ExaDrive’s design, using four PCBs of NAND each with its own controller and an FPGA intermediary before the SAS/SATA interface, the ExaDrive NL maintains high endurance and low write amplification as well as a standard 4K block size. The drive also has overprovisioning, around the 8% level as is industry standard.", "The new ExaDrive NL versions will be offered in capacities including 16 TB, 32 TB, and 64 TB, with SATA and dual-port SAS interfaces. These drives don’t have an unlimited endurance 5-year warranty like the DC 100 TB model, but are rated up to 75 PB within the 5 years, which is good for 0.6 DWPD. However, writing 60% of the 64 TB drive at SATA speeds will take 1.7 days anyway, indicating that this drive should be good for a long time.", "Performance is rated at 500 MB/s read and 460 MB/s write with sequential 128 KB data, and up to 100K read/write IOPs with 4K data. The drives do operate an SLC cache, and Nimbus Data was keen to point out that these drives ‘in typical scenarios’ will never go outside that SLC cache window. Also, the fact that the design is four PCBs of NAND each with its own controller means that write performance is almost identical to read performance, which negates one of the common criticisms with QLC. Latency is in the 50-100 microsecond range. Power consumption is rated at 10W idle and 14W typical for the 64 TB model, and the 3.5-inch enclosure is ventilated to assist this.", "One of the comments Nimbus Data made is that in these big 3.5-inch JBOD designs that can hold 90 drives in a 4U, as hard drives spin up and get warm, the drives furthest from the front of the chassis end up with warm air on them, and then the CPU behind that also gets even warmer air. The lower power consumption of NAND helps with that, and the additional ventilation should also keep the drives cooler as required. Also, those vertical drop design chassis are apparently more suited to NAND – Nimbus Data’s CEO in our briefing call stated that in speaking to customers, he learned that vertically mounted HDD reliability is reduced ~5-10%, something which a NAND SSD wouldn’t have a problem with. Also, with regards array rebuild time if these drives were in an array, we were told that due to using NAND that despite the large drive size, rebuilding a 64 TB SSD is quicker than any of the 18 TB HDDs.", "The key targets Nimbus Data is hoping to hit with the new ExaDrive NL series is that nearline / CDN type storage, but at a better latency, better density per rack unit, better power per TB, and better OpEx per TB over the lifetime of the hardware. Nimbus Data predicts an 80% reduction in power and cooling costs per TB with its product, as well as potential savings in software licensing (fewer servers needed), reduced admin costs (fewer servers to manage), and a better blending of SSD/HDD as needed with respect to performance and cost. The other metric Nimbus Data is proud of is weight per TB, with an 18 TB HDD weighing ~1.5 lbs, whereas the 64 TB NL drive weighs ~0.87 lbs, an 87% reduction per TB.", "In order to assuage concerns about compatibility, Nimbus Data is quoting that the drives have already been tested in a number of high-profile and popular server and storage designs, including PowerEdge Rx40 devices and PERC HBAs, HPE DL300 Gen10 with SmartArray Gen10 storage adaptors, Cisco UCS designs and also Lenovo ThinkSystem and Supermicro builds. A full list is in the slide deck we’ve republished here.", "We were told that Nimbus Data currently sells its large 3.5-inch SSD drives mostly into edge deployments, where data density is critical, and these new NL drives will help deliver to customers currently on spinning HDDs that required a better price per TB ratio before jumping to NAND. Pricing will be customer-specific, however the 16 TB model will start through authorized resellers and system manufacturers for under $3000.", "We’re hoping to get the new ExaDrive NL and perhaps the DC in to test. Stay tuned for that.", " "]},
{"title": "The Best NVMe SSD for Laptops and Notebooks: SK hynix Gold P31 1TB SSD Reviewed", "paragraph": ["SK hynix is one of the major DRAM and NAND flash memory manufacturers, but for years they've had little to no presence in the retail consumer SSD market and have focused primarily on the OEM market. That started to change last year when they launched their Gold S31 SATA SSDs, but that wasn't really enough to establish SK hynix as an important brand for consumer SSDs. At CES in January, they previewed NVMe SSDs: the Gold P31 and Platinum P31.", "When SK hynix PR reached out earlier this month to offer a review sample of the Gold P31 at short notice in advance of last week's launch, I was expecting a fairly straightforward review. Rushed review embargo periods are often a sign that the vendor doesn't want you to spend too much time digging into the details of the product, so I didn't expect the Gold P31 to stand out in any way from the crowd of other PCIe Gen3 NVMe SSDs already on the market. I was expecting that the most interesting facet of the Gold P31 would be the fact that SK hynix actually managed to be first to market with 128L NAND, after years of trying to run ahead of the competition in terms of 3D NAND layer count but with little success in following through in a timely fashion.", "The 128L 3D NAND is an important accomplishment, but it turns out to have big consequences for more than just cost. The Gold P31 turned in the most surprising set of benchmark results I've seen, with power efficiency scores that seemed almost too good to be true (more on this later). SK hynix won't share quite as much technical information about these drives as we'd like to have, but they've shared enough to confirm that the Gold P31 does not fit the mold for a typical high-end consumer NVMe SSD.", "The Gold P31 offers performance that is competitive with most other high-end consumer SSDs, but it achieves that performance with a very different strategy. For years, the standard formula for this product segment has been the use of TLC NAND with SLC caching, a controller with four lanes of PCIe 3.0 (and starting to move toward PCIe 4.0), DRAM in a ratio of 1 GB per 1TB of flash, and an eight-channel interface between the SSD controller and the NAND flash itself. It's that last piece that the Gold P31 changes, by using just four channels.", "The SK hynix Gold P31 hits high-end performance targets with half the channels by using a much higher IO speed for those channels than we're used to. This NAND interface speed hasn't been an important factor in recent years because an 8 channel SSD can saturate a PCIe 3 x4 host connection with fairly pedestrian NAND interface speeds like 533MT/s. So even though NAND manufacturers and SSD controllers have been moving toward higher interface speeds, it has hardly mattered and has been much less interesting than talking about improvements in latency, power and density.", "For the 64-layer 3D NAND generation, NAND interface speeds were typically in the 533-667MT/s range. The extremely popular Phison E12 controller ", ", but SSDs using Toshiba (now Kioxia) 64L BiCS3 TLC at 533MT/s had no trouble offering good performance—usually only marginally slower than Silicon Motion's SM2262(EN) that supports up to 800MT/s. Now that the NAND market has moved to 96 layers and beyond, most NAND manufacturers can support speeds of 1.2GT/s (1200MT/s) or higher—but those speeds aren't a given. Just like DRAM, NAND chips can come in different speed grades, and not all SSD controllers can handle those speeds yet. SK hynix designs their own SSD controllers, and they updated their controller design to match the capabilities of their 128L NAND, running at 1.2GT/s. This provides plenty of headroom for a 4-channel SSD to saturate a PCIe 3.0 x4 link.", "(Side note: The Sony PS5 will use a 12 channel controller, which means it should be able to hit its performance targets with a 533MT/s NAND interface speed. The Xbox Series X is likely using a 4-channel controller, so it will probably need to use a faster NAND interface speed despite the SSD as a whole offering less than half the throughput.)", "We're used to seeing 4-channel NVMe SSDs as entry-level products. Those have mostly been using slower NAND interface speeds and offered peak throughput in the ballpark of just 2-2.5 GB/s, and the lower channel count has primarily been a cost-cutting measure (often paired with an elimination of the DRAM buffer to further reduce costs). The SK hynix controller used in the Gold P31 may be cheaper and smaller than the typical 8-channel PCIe gen3 NVMe controller, but it's designed to compete directly against them. SK hynix won't say whether the controller is built on the 28nm process that's used for most PCIe Gen3 NVMe controllers or if they've moved to a smaller FinFET-based node as we're seeing for almost all PCIE Gen4 controller designs. Either way, their controller starts off with a significant power advantage over larger 8-channel controllers.", "The SK hynix Gold P31 product line consists of just two capacities: 500GB and 1TB, with only the latter sampled for this review. The Platinum P31 that was announced at CES will be a 2TB model and we expect it to otherwise be identical to the Gold P31, but no further information about the Platinum P31 or its release date is available at this time. SK hynix provides fairly detailed performance specs for the Gold P31: we don't get the low queue depth ratings that matter most, but the high queue depth specs are broken down to show both SLC cache and post-cache TLC performance. The 500 GB model is rated for much lower TLC write speeds than the 1 TB model, but otherwise their performance ratings are similar and typical for a high-end PCIe gen3 drive.", "The Gold P31 comes with better than average write endurance ratings: 500 TBW for the 500 GB model and 750 TBW for the 1TB model, putting them both above the standard 0.3 DWPD. Introductory pricing is fairly competitive at $75 and $135.", "SK hynix won't confirm details about the NAND other than the layer count and the 1.2GT/s IO speed, but based on their previous announcements about their 128L 3D NAND we believe these are 1Tbit dies, each divided into four planes so they can offer comparable parallelism to 512Gbit dies that are only divided into two planes. (UPDATE: ", ", and it seems to be 512Gbit dies.) With their short-lived 96L generation, SK hynix adopted what they call a PuC: periphery under cell. This is basically the same idea as the Intel/Micron CMOS under the Array 3D NAND design, that moves most of the peripheral logic circuitry under the memory cell array, rather than alongside. This design has allowed Intel/Micron 3D NAND to achieve the smallest die sizes for a given layer count and die capacity. Now that SK hynix has adopted this and delivered a leading layer count, they should have one of the most cost-effective TLC parts on the market (provided they're getting good yields). The rest of the major NAND flash manufacturers have a similar technique on their roadmaps.", "For this review, we are primarily comparing the SK hynix Gold P31 against other high-end TLC-based NVMe drives. Some of these are drives using 64L NAND rather than 96L NAND because we have either been unable to get samples of the newer drives, or we haven't gotten around to testing them.  The high-end TLC drives included in this review are:", "We have also included results from a few entry-level NVMe drives:", "The SK hynix Gold S31 and Samsung 860 EVO SATA drives also included for context."]},
{"title": "Samsung 980 PRO Briefly Listed Online", "paragraph": ["In what seems to be an accidental leak, a product page for the highly-awaited Samsung 980 PRO SSD was posted and later taken down from Samsung's website for Singapore. The 980 PRO was first previewed in January at CES as their first consumer SSD to support PCIe 4.0, but with very little technical information. No release date was announced but Samsung's PR said to expect more information in Q2.", "The timing of this leak is unsurprising: if Samsung was planning for a Q2 or early Q3 release before COVID-19 hit, it makes sense for them to be preparing for a release in the near future. However, this leak brings a few surprise about what kind of product the 980 PRO will be. Since this wasn't an official, coordinated announcement, the specifications revealed may not be final and we still have no indication of pricing or launch date. But the big surprise is that the 980 PRO will apparently be using TLC NAND, a first for Samsung's PRO models. Samsung has been the last holdout offering high-end MLC-based SSDs while the rest of the SSD industry has moved on to TLC (and QLC), for both consumer and enterprise markets. Samsung provided an early indication that they may finally be abandoning MLC NAND in early 2019 when the TLC-based 970 EVO was replaced with the 970 EVO Plus, a refresh that switched from 64L to 92L TLC. There was never any sign of a corresponding 970 PRO Plus model in the works.", "The switch from MLC to TLC means the rated write endurance of the 980 PRO will be half that of the 970 PRO and equivalent to the TLC-based 970 EVO and EVO Plus. The upside is that the 980 PRO may be more competitively priced against other high-end consumer NVMe SSDs. It's also quite possible that Samsung needed to introduce SLC caching in order to hit the 5GB/s write speeds they're promising for the 980 PRO.", "The product page for the 980 PRO indicated that sequential read speed is now planned to be 7 GB/s, an improvement over the 6.5 GB/s listed earlier this year at CES. We also get our first look at random IO specifications, with the 1TB model hitting a maximum of 1M IOPS for either reads or writes. Performance at a queue depth of 1 is slightly improved over the 970 PRO and 970 EVO Plus, and post-cache sequential write speeds are also up from the 970 EVO Plus. This points to the 980 PRO as likely using Samsung's 1xx-layer 3D TLC rather than the 92L used in the 970 EVO Plus.", "Power consumption from the 980 PRO is unsurprisingly higher than its predecessors, with the spec sheet showing 6.2W average and 8.9W in burst mode. Samsung's high-end NVMe SSDs have already been fairly power-hungry, and making use of PCIe 4.0 speeds requires even more power. However, the 980 PRO should bring a substantial improvement in efficiency, because peak performance is doubling but power draw is not increasing by anywhere near that much. Samsung is likely following the same strategy as most other SSD controller designers by moving to a much newer fabrication process as part of the PCIe 4.0 transition.", "The capacity options for the 980 PRO are a bit odd. The 970 PRO was offered in 512GB and 1TB capacities, and a 2TB capacity was hinted at but never made it to market. The lack of a 256GB option made some sense as that low capacity would likely not have been able to offer PRO-level performance. The 980 PRO moves to Samsung's typical TLC capacities: 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, but still omits the 2TB option that has been available from the EVOs. It seems likely that a 2TB 980 PRO model would be released at a later date.", "Moving the 980 PRO to TLC NAND raises big questions for what to expect from a 980 EVO. Moving it to QLC NAND might be a bit premature, and would definitely be a big step down for that product line even if it added PCIe 4.0 support. My expectation is that any 980 EVO would more likely be a lower-performance, lower-power mainstream TLC drive, possibly without PCIe 4.0 support. Or to put it another way, an answer to the SK hynix Gold P31, which we think represents the direction the mainstream NVMe market segment is moving towards."]},

{"title": "The Samsung 980 PRO PCIe 4.0 SSD Review: A Spirit of Hope", "paragraph": ["It may be a bit later than originally planned, but Samsung's first consumer SSD to support PCIe 4.0 is here. The Samsung 980 PRO was first previewed at CES in January, but we didn't hear anything further until leaks started appearing towards the end of summer. Now the 980 PRO is set to kick off a new wave of PCIe 4.0 SSD releases. These new changes are the most significant changes to Samsung's PRO SSD line since the debut of its first NVMe drive.", "As we march onto a world where PCIe 4.0 is going to start being offered to the vast majority of consumers in all segments of computing, the move is on in order to enable support for these new standards. Benefits such as increased peak speed, or decreased power consumption, are obvious vital specifications that PCIe 4.0 brings to the table, and thus having optimized products to go along with it has always been the case as new generations trump the told. Samsung's first PCIe 4.0 x4 offering for consumers is the 980 PRO, a series of M.2 drives with capacities up to 2.0 TB. ", "These new drives feature the latest in Samsung's controller design, but also mark the change from 2-bit cells to 3-bit cells for the Pro line of drives. This creates changes for increased capacity and decreased cost, and due to Samsung's controller technology the lower theoretical endurace we might expect with TLC is still covered by the warranty. Samsung's Pro line of storage drives have always been designed to impress, always being in the upper echelons for performance for the market. This is what we're here to test in this review.", "Today we are testing the 250 GB and 1 TB models, representing the current minimum and maximum of what is on offer. The 2 TB model is set to come to retail at a later date, along with its respective specifications.", "AMD kicked off the transition to PCIe 4.0 last year with the release of their Zen 2 family of CPUs. This started the first phase of PCIe 4.0 SSDs, starting with Phison.", "Phison was the only SSD controller vendor ready with a PCIe 4.0 solution at the time; its E16 controller has enjoyed over a year on the market as the only option for consumer PCIe 4.0 SSDs. We're reported ", "as well. But the Phison E16 was a bit of a rushed design, with a minimum of changes to their highly successful E12 controller to enable PCIe 4.0 support. That left the E16 with some notable shortcomings: it only offers slightly more peak bandwidth provided by the upgrade to PCIe 4.0, and the extra performance comes with a lot of extra power consumption. The rest of the SSD industry decided to take the PCIe 4.0 transition a bit more slowly, preparing more mature controller designs to be manufactured on smaller process nodes that can provide the efficiency necessary to use the full speed of a PCIe 4.0 x4 link while staying within the thermal and power constraints of a M.2 drive.", "All the major players in the SSD controller market have been preparing for this second wave of Gen4 drives, but Samsung is making the first move in this round. The 980 PRO introduces the new Samsung Elpis controller, built on their 8nm process and designed to double the peak performance offered by PCIe Gen3 SSDs.", "In addition to the new Elpis controller, the 980 PRO introduces a new generation of 3D NAND flash memory from Samsung. Officially, Samsung isn't disclosing the layer count, but they've claimed it's 40% more than their previous generation which was 92L, so this should be 128L 3D NAND. Samsung isn't the first to market with 128L NAND (SK hynix by less than a month), but it shows that layer counts are increasing and capacity should be as well.", "Historically, the PRO line of SSDs use some of Samsung's fastest and most durable NAND available - this is what gives the products the PRO name. This time around, Samsung is changing things to help expand its Pro line customer base - Samsung is abandoning the use of the two bit per cell (MLC) memory that has been the hallmark of the PRO product lines, and with the 980 PRO, Samsung is finally switching to three bit per cell (TLC) NAND flash memory. This change is not unprecedented: Samsung has been almost completely alone in their continued use of 2-bit MLC NAND. By comparison, the rest of the SSD industry (consumer and enterprise) has moved from MLC to TLC, even on the leading edge designs. ", "The historical reasoning for choosing MLC NAND over TLC NAND has always boiled down to two main factors: MLC tends to be faster, and it has higher write endurance. TLC NAND may be slower than MLC NAND in general, but that doesn't mean that TLC SSDs have to be slower than MLC SSDs. The performance advantages of MLC NAND for consumer use have been greatly reduced by the universal adoption of SLC write caching on TLC SSDs, and the trend toward larger SLC caches. Unless a user is going well beyond the SLC cache, a TLC drive with an SLC cache is noticably more preferable from a capacity standpoint than an MLC drive.", "Write endurance has always been an important issue to keep an eye on, but the SSD industry has successfully prevented it from becoming a serious problem for consumers. Improved error correction and the fundamental advantages of 3D NAND over older planar NAND have helped, but the biggest factor has been the growth of drive capacities. The total write endurance of a SSD scales roughly linearly with its capacity: a 2TB drive can handle about twice as many TB of writes over its lifespan as a 1TB drive. However, consumer storage needs don't grow in the same way as enterprise storage needs. When a consumer moves from a 512GB drive to 1TB or 2TB, most of the extra capacity that gets used is for relatively static data: photos, videos and games that aren't modified all that often, and certainly not multiple times a day. ", "The 980 PRO's use of TLC instead of MLC may be the end of an era for SSDs, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the drive isn't worthy of the PRO name; the 980 PRO is still very clearly at the high end of the consumer market.", "", "In many ways, this drive could have easily been labeled the 980 EVO as a replacement for the 970 EVO Plus. Along with switching to TLC NAND, Samsung has cut the write endurance ratings in half to 0.3 DWPD and dropped the usable capacities down to the typical TLC/EVO levels of 250/500/1000 GB instead of 256/512/1024 GB. TLC means the 980 PRO now relies on SLC caching for its peak write speeds, and write performance will drop substantially if the SLC cache is ever filled. However, Samsung has offset this by configuring the 980 PRO to use substantially larger SLC cache sizes than their previous EVO drives, and this is what will give it the Pro name more than anything else.. MSRPs are also now much lower, and comparable to other TLC-based PCIe 4 SSDs.", "The basic layout and look of Samsung's M.2 NVMe SSDs has changed little over the years even as the components have been upgraded. The Elpis controller is their second to feature a metal heatspreader on the controller package. This is the third generation of drives to use copper foil in the label on the back of the drive as an additional heatspreader.", "After the PCIe 4 support and 8nm fab process, the next most important feature of the new Samsung Elpis is its support for 128 IO queues, up from 32 in the previous Phoenix controller. The most common use case for multiple IO queues on a NVMe SSD is for the OS to assign one queue per CPU core, so that no core-to-core synchronization is required for software to submit new IO commands to the SSD. Now that CPU core counts have grown well beyond 32, it makes sense for Samsung to support more queues—especially since these NVMe controllers are also used in Samsung's entry-level enterprise and datacenter NVMe SSDs.", "For today's review, we're focused specifically on high-end consumer SSDs. The drives to pay attention to are:", "We're also going to add in a PCIe 3.0 x8 enterprise drive, the Samsung PM1725a. The PM1725a is an interesting choice as it is a 6.4TB high-end enterprise SSD that's a few years old. It  has as much PCIe bandwidth as new PCIe 4.0 x4 SSDs, but the PM1725a is tuned for enterprise use cases: its lack of SLC caching hurts peak write performance, but its read throughput is still impressive at over 6GB/s for sequential and over 1M IOPS for random reads. The downside is that it can require 20+ Watts to deliver that kind of performance. We shall see if the jump from PCIe 3.0x8 to PCIe4.0x4 of its own makes it worth it.", "As always, comparisons against other drives can be made using our Bench tool."]},

However, it should still deliver solid performance for all but the most demanding prosumer use cases, especially since it looks like Intel won't be offering PCIe gen4 host support this year. The P5 also includes support for all the usual encryption standards, features that are missing from many high-end NVMe SSDs that target the consumer market exclusively and not business customers.", "The Crucial P2 is their second entry-level NVMe SSD, but it is not a direct replacement for the QLC-based P1. The P2 is at least initially only available in low capacities of 250GB and 500GB, and cuts costs by using a DRAMless controller with TLC NAND rather than the P1's combination of cheaper QLC NAND but a controller with a DRAM cache. Micron hasn't disclosed what controller is used on the P2, but it seems likely they're sourcing from a third party as with previous Crucial SSDs—and it might not even be the same controller for both capacities. While both capacities have performance specs that fall within the ranges we expect for a four-channel DRAMless NVMe SSD, the 500GB model is actually the slower one by most metrics.  This indicates that at least one of either the NAND or the controller is meaningfully different from the 250GB model. The 500GB might be using NAND parts with a higher per-die capacity and thus not have any greater parallelism, or it may be using an entirely different controller (or both).

It's unlikely that the P5 will be switched to QLC NAND, but much like the MX500 SATA drive this model might stick around for years even after a replacement with a faster interface (PCIe 4) is introduced. In that case, it would be reasonable to expect the P5 to be updated with a newer generation of TLC NAND, and performance probably won't change significantly. The P2 product line could easily become a mix of TLC and QLC, which Micron has done with the entry-level BX500 SATA SSDs. If/when the P2 gets 1TB or larger capacity options those would seem likely to use QLC NAND, and the 500GB model could probably also be switched to QLC given that its rated performance is not too different from the 500GB P1.

We have some top-line performance numbers and general architectural information from Microsoft and Sony, but not quite a full spec sheet.", "The new generation of consoles will bring big increases in CPU and GPU capabilities, but we get that with every new generation and it's no surprise when console chips get the same microarchitecture updates as the AMD CPUs and GPUs they're derived from. What's more special with this generation is the change to storage: the consoles are following in the footsteps of the PC market by switching from mechanical hard drives to solid state storage, but also going a step beyond the PC market to get the most benefit out of solid state storage.", "", "Solid State Drives were revolutionary for the PC market, providing immense improvements to overall system responsiveness. Games benefited mostly in the form of faster installation and level load times, but fast storage also helped reduce stalls and stuttering when a game needs to load data on the fly. In recent years, NVMe SSDs have provided speeds that are on paper several times faster than what is possible with SATA SSDs, but for gamers the benefits have been muted at best. Conventional wisdom holds that there are two main causes to suspect for this disappointment: First, almost all games and game engines are still designed to be playable off hard drives because current consoles and many low-end PCs lack SSDs. Game programmers cannot take full advantage of NVMe SSD performance without making their games unplayably slow on hard drives. Second, SATA SSDs are already fast enough to shift the bottleneck elsewhere in the system, often in the form of data decompression. Something aside from the SSD needs to be sped up before games can properly benefit from NVMe performance.", "Microsoft and Sony are addressing both of those issues with their upcoming consoles. Game developers will soon be free to assume that users will have fast storage, both on consoles and on PCs. In addition, the new generation of consoles will add extra hardware features to address bottlenecks that would be present if they were merely mid-range gaming PCs equipped with cutting-edge SSDs. However, we're still dealing with powerful hype operations promoting these upcoming devices. Both companies are guilty of exaggerating or oversimplifying in their attempts to extol the new capabilities of their next consoles, especially with regards to the new SSDs. And since these consoles are still closed platforms that aren't even on the market yet, some of the most interesting technical details are still being kept secret.", "The main source of official technical information about the PS5 (and especially its SSD) is lead designer Mark Cerny. In March, he gave an hour-long technical presentation about the PS5 and spent over a third of it focusing on storage. Less officially, Sony has filed several patents that apparently pertain to the PS5, including one that lines up well with what's been confirmed about the PS5's storage technology. That patent discloses numerous ideas Sony explored in the development of the PS5, and many of them are likely implemented in the final design.", "Microsoft has taken the approach of more or less dribbling out technical details through sporadic blog posts and interviews, especially with DigitalFoundry (who also have good coverage of the PS5). They've introduced brand names for many of their storage-related technologies (eg. Xbox Velocity Architecture), but in too many cases we don't really know anything about a feature other than its name.", "Aside from official sources, we also have leaks, comments and rumors of varying quality, from partners and other industry sources.

Sony's solution aims for more than twice the performance of Microsoft's solution and is definitely more costly even though it will have the lower capacity. Broadly speaking, Sony's SSD will offer similar performance to the high-end PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs we expect to see on the retail market by the end of the year, while Microsoft's SSD is more comparable to entry-level NVMe drives. Both are a huge step forward from mechanical hard drives or even SATA SSDs.", "The most important and impressive performance metric for the console SSDs is their sequential read speed. SSD write speed is almost completely irrelevant to video game performance, and even when games perform random reads it will usually be for larger chunks of data than the 4kB blocks that SSD random IO performance ratings are normally based upon. Microsoft's 2.4GB/s read speed is 10–20 times faster than what a mechanical hard drive can deliver, but falls well short of the current standards for high-end consumer SSDs which can saturate a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface with at least 3.5GB/s read speeds. Sony's 5.5GB/s read speed is slightly faster than currently-available PCIe 4.0 SSDs based on the Phison E16 controller, but everyone competing in the high-end consumer SSD market has more advanced solutions on the way. By the time it ships, the PS5 SSD's read performance will be unremarkable – matched by other high-end SSDs – except in the context of consoles and low-cost gaming PCs that usually don't have room in the budget for high-end storage.", "Sony has disclosed that their SSD uses a custom controller with a 12-channel interface to the NAND flash memory. This seems to be the most important way in which their design differs from typical consumer SSDs. High-end consumer SSDs generally use 8-channel controllers and low-end drives often use 4 channels. Higher channel counts are more common for server SSDs, especially those that need to support extreme capacities; 16-channel controllers are common and 12 or 18 channel designs are not unheard of. Sony's use of a higher channel count than any recent consumer SSD means their SSD controller will be uncommonly large and expensive, but on the other hand they don't need as much performance from each channel in order to reach their 5.5GB/s goal. They could use any 64-layer or newer TLC NAND and have adequate performance, while consumer SSDs hoping to offer this level of performance or more with 8-channel controllers need to be paired with newer, faster NAND flash.", "The 12-channel controller also leads to unusual total capacities. A console SSD doesn't need any more overprovisioning than typical consumer SSDs, so 50% more channels should translate to about 50% more usable capacity. The PS5 will ship with 825 GB of SSD space, which means we should see each of the 12 channels equipped with 64GiB of raw NAND, organized as either one 512Gbit (64GB) die or two 256Gbit (32GB) dies per channel. That means the nominal raw capacity of the NAND is 768GiB or about 824.6 (decimal) GB. The ", " capacity after accounting for the requisite spare area reserved by the drive is probably going to be more in line with what would be branded as 750 GB by a drive manufacturer, so Sony's 825GB is overstating things by about 10% more than normal for the storage industry. It's something that may make a few lawyers salivate.", "It's probably worth mentioning here that it is unrealistic for Sony to have designed their own high-performance NVMe SSD controller, just like they can't do a CPU or GPU design on their own. Sony had to partner with an existing SSD controller vendor and commission a custom controller, probably assembled largely from pre-existing and proven IP, but we don't know who that partner is.", "Microsoft's SSD won't be pushing performance at all beyond normal new PC levels now that OEMs have moved beyond SATA SSDs, but a full 1TB in a PC priced similarly to consoles would still be a big win for consumers. Multiple sources indicate that Microsoft is using an off-the-shelf SSD controller from one of the usual suspects (probably the Phison E19T controller), and the drive itself is built by a major SSD OEM. However, they can still lay claim to using a custom form factor and probably custom firmware.", "Neither console vendor has shared official information about the internals of their SSD aside from Sony's 12-channel specification, but the capacities and performance numbers give us a clue about what to expect. Sony's pretty much committed to using TLC NAND, but Microsoft's lower performance target is down in the territory where QLC NAND is an option: 2.4GB/s is a bit more than we see from current 4-channel QLC drives like the Intel 665p (about 2GB/s) but much less than 8-channel QLC drives like the Sabrent Rocket Q (rated 3.2GB/s for the 1TB model). The best fit for Microsoft's expected performance among current SSD designs would be a 4-channel drive with TLC NAND, but newer 4-channel controllers like the Phison E19T should be able to hit those speeds with the right QLC NAND. Either console could conceivably in the future get a double-capacity version that uses QLC NAND to reach the same read performance of the original models.", "Without performance specs for writes or random reads, we cannot rule out the possibility of either console SSD using a DRAMless controller. Including a full-sized DRAM cache for the flash translation layer (FTL) tables on a SSD primarily helps performance in two ways: better sustained write speeds when the drive's full enough to require a lot of background work shuffling data around, and better random access speed when reading data across the full range of the drive. Neither of those really fits the console use case: very heavily read-oriented, and only accessing one game's dataset at a time. Even if game install sizes end up being in the 100-200GB range, at any given moment the amount of data used by a game won't be more than low tens of GB, and that is easily handled by DRAMless SSDs with a decent amount of SRAM on the controller itself. Going DRAMless seems very likely for Microsoft's SSD, and while it would be very strange in any other context to see a 12-channel DRAMless controller, that option does seem to be viable for Sony (and would offset the cost of the high channel count).", "The Sony patent mentioned earlier goes in depth on how to make a DRAMless controller even more suitable for console use cases. Rather than caching a portion of the FTL's logical-to-physical address mapping table in on-controller SRAM, Sony proposes making the table itself small enough to fit in a small SRAM buffer. Mainstream SSDs have a ratio of 1 GB of DRAM for each 1 TB of flash memory. That ratio is a direct consequence of the FTL managing flash in 4kB chunks. Having the FTL manage flash in larger chunks directly reduces the memory requirements for the mapping table. The downside is that small writes will cause much more write amplification and be much slower. Western Digital sells a ", " that uses 32kB chunks for its FTL rather than 4kB, and as a result it only needs an eighth the amount of DRAM. That drive's random write performance is poor, but the read performance is still competitive. Sony's patent proposes going way beyond 32kB chunks to using 128MB chunks for the FTL, shrinking the mapping table to mere kilobytes. That requires the host system to be very careful about when and where it writes data, but the read performance that gaming relies upon is not compromised.", "In short, while the Sony SSD should be very fast for its intended purpose, I'm going to wager that you ", " wouldn't want it in your Windows PC. The same is probably true to some extent of Microsoft's SSD, depending on their firmware tuning decisions.", "Both Microsoft and Sony are providing expandability for the NVMe storage of their upcoming consoles. Microsoft's solution is to re-package their internal SSD into a custom removable form factor reminiscent of what consoles used back when memory cards were measured in MB instead of TB and before USB flash drives were ubiquitous. Since it uses all the same components, this expansion card will be functionally identical to the internal storage. The downside is that Microsoft will control the supply and probably pricing of the cards; currently Seagate is the only confirmed partner for selling these proprietary expansion cards.", "Sony is taking the opposite approach, by giving users access to a standard M.2 PCIe 4.0 slot that can accept aftermarket upgrades. The requirements aren't entirely clear: Sony will be doing compatibility testing with third-party drives in order to publish a compatibility list, but they haven't said whether drives not on their approved list will be rejected by the PS5 console. To make it onto Sony's compatibility list, a drive will need to mechanically fit (ie. no excessively large heatsink) and offer at least as much performance as Sony's custom internal SSD. The performance requirements mean no drive currently available at retail will qualify, but the situation will be very different next year."]},

Today we're launching our updated 2020 Enterprise SSD test suite, and in order top draw comparisons of new to old, we're taking a look at two SATA SSDs that have almost nothing in common. From Kingston, we have their latest entry-level offering that stretches the definition of an enterprise SSD in pursuit of affordability. At the other end of the spectrum, we have the Micron 5100 MAX, a top of the line flagship model from two generations ago; old but not necessarily obsolete. We also have other drives in the mix, tested on the new suite, however these two are our main focus.", "The Kingston DC450R is part of a burgeoning market segment for entry-level server SSDs that compromise on one or more key features that traditionally define enterprise SSDs. Entry-level drives always tend to have endurance ratings and overprovisioning ratios comparable to consumer SSDs. That's certainly true of the DC450R, but it also eschews power loss protection capacitors. For many traditional server use cases, such as transactional databases, that would immediately disqualify the DC450R. But many of the most read-oriented workloads do not particularly need the extra data integrity assurances that power-loss capacitors provide - these use cases are fine with relying just on a accessing a filesystem (that likely has redundancy regardless). Content Delivery Network (CDN) servers are the best example of this: they only need to mirror content distributed from a central source, and there are no serious consequences if a single CDN node goes down—but they still can benefit from SSD performance.", "The Kingston DC450R is a clear derivative of the DC500 series. We're looking at the same basic PCB layout, but now with empty pads where the DC500s have power loss protection capacitors. Our 3.84TB DC450R sample includes 4GB of DDR4-2666 DRAM and sixteen NAND packages each containing 256GB, spread across four dies of 512Gbit each. The NAND this time is Kioxia/Toshiba BiCS4 96L TLC. This is rated for 3k Program/Erase cycles compared to the 5k P/E rating of the 64L Intel TLC used in the DC500 series.", " ", "The 1.92TB Micron 5100 MAX may seem to be an odd drive to be reviewing in 2020, given that it was announced at the end of 2016 and has been replaced by two newer generations. We're reviewing it because MyDigitalDiscount has a batch of several thousand unused drives from an OEM excess deal, and they're selling them off for $299.99 each. That's in the same ballpark as the DC450R above and other entry-level server SSDs. And the 5100 MAX was top of the line for its time, rated for 5 drive writes per day and loaded with all the bells and whistles (TCG Enterprise encryption, power loss protection capacitors). Because the SATA interface hasn't gotten any faster in the years since the 5100 MAX was released, it stands a good chance of holding its own against modern drives.

The NAND flash is Micron 32L 3D TLC. This was Micron's first generation of 3D NAND and the die was designed as more of a MLC-first product even though it ended up being used predominantly as TLC. So what would have been 256Gbit dies as MLC are used as 384Gbit TLC parts, and four of them per package adds up to 192GB. Sixteen of these gives a nominal raw capacity of about 3072 GiB on a drive with 1920GB usable capacity, for an incredible 42% overprovisioning ratio compared to the 12% on the Kingston DC450R. The 5100 MAX uses 2GB of Micron DDR3-1600 DRAM. The power loss protection capacitors are lined up around the edges of the PCB.", "One unusual feature of the 5100 MAX is that it will optionally use 12V power if provided. Most SATA SSDs use the 5V supply exclusively, and the 5100 MAX can run without the 12V supply. Our testing was conducted with the 12V supply turned on, but it wasn't until we saw power efficiency scores that looked too good to be true that we realized the calculations needed to include the 12V rail for this drive needed.

From Kingston we have the DC500R and DC500M, the next two steps up their enterprise SSD product lineup. There are few direct competitors to the Micron 5100 MAX from current-generation SSDs; the high-performance/high-endurance market segments have largely moved over to NVMe or are lingering on SAS. Even Samsung's SM883 MLC SATA drive is only rated for 3 DWPD to the Micron's 5 DWPD. But at the price MyDigitalDiscount is charging for their stock of the 5100 MAX, it's totally fair to compare it against the more recent low-end enterprise SATA models.

{"title": "Kioxia: 3D Stacked Storage Class Memory, like 3D XPoint, Isn’t the Future", "paragraph": ["One of the key battlegrounds of the next decade is going to be storage: density, speed, and demand. Naturally all the major players in the space want to promote their own technologies of that of their competitors, and Kioxia (formerly Toshiba Memory) is no different. This year during their plenary talk at the International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) the company set forth its promotion of its BiCS flash product family, as well as its upcoming XL-Flash technology. What was interesting during this talk is a graph that seems to slam the long-term prospects of any of the upcoming Storage Class Memory (SCM) technologies like 3D XPoint from Intel and Micron.", "Memory at its basic level is having a property of a cell that can be calculated and converted into data. A simple DRAM cell contains electrons, and the presence / absence of electrons determine whether the value of that cell is a 1 or a 0. Flash storage memory has gone through several changes over the last couple of decades, with floating gate and charge trap technologies helping drive the manufacturing and scaling of storage. New types of memory are in various states of development/manufacture/shipping that rely on the resistance of the medium in the cell, or the spin of the medium in the cell, rather than the voltage.", "Traditionally it is easy to think of each cell as a straight forward 0 or 1, on or off, with two distinct detection levels. However, depending on the type materials used, it can be possible to detect multiple levels within a single cell. The industry moved from 1-bit per cell (0 or 1) to 2-bits per cell (00, 01, 10, 11) to 3-bits per cell (000, 001, 010, etc) onwards, with the leading storage products now on four bits per cell and looking at even more than this. ‘DRAM’ time memory has always been a 1-bit per cell medium, however storage has been going through the motions of increasing the number of bits per cell. Moving to more bits per cell gets extra storage capacity, in effect, for ‘free’, however it requires the materials to have tighter tolerances and the detection circuitry to be more precise, and one way to do both of those is to increase the size of the cell, decreasing the density overall. The more bits per cell, the difficulty becomes in distinguishing between the property levels in 2 to the power of the number of bits. It’s an interesting conundrum.", "Kioxia’s current BiCS flash storage technology relies on stacking multiple layers of floating gate cells in a tower, and then repeating that design in the x-y directions to increase capacity. Kioxia currently ships a lot of 3-bit per cell and 4-bit per cell products, with the company looking at 5-bit per cell for special applications. The BiCs family of products has also been increasing the number of layers in its design, from 32 layer to 48 layer to 64 layer and now currently up to 96-layer, with 128+ layer in the future expected to arrive. Adding layers, by contrast to other methods, is fairly easy.", "Kioxia is also building a new type of Flash called XL-Flash, which again adds another layer of parallelism to the concept of flash.", "Storage Class Memory is slightly different to traditional flash memory. Memory works at a ‘bit’ level of access, while flash memory works at a ‘page’ and ‘block’ level. This means that while DRAM can access each bit and modify it, in flash it means that any write operation to the flash requires a whole page to be written at once. This means that every read-modify-write operation needs to read the full page, choose which bits are going to change, and re-write the page in full. This increases the wear on the drive (the number of read/write cycles), and there are many techniques in play in order to reduce the wear through wear levelling, spare storage area, and such. Memory by contrast needs to work at a bit level, and each bit needs to be selectable and adjustable – ‘storage class memory’ must therefore be able to act like memory at all times, and then be used for storage reasons when possible. The benefit of memory is meant to be its seemingly infinite (>10^18) cycle lifetime and low access latency, however it isn’t always that easy.", "3D Stacked storage-class memory cells work a little different to flash. The easiest example here is 3D XPoint, which uses a phase change material to alter the resistance of a memory cell, and is accessed through an ovonic selector switch. The memory is built up through alternating the direction of word lines and bit lines to retain the bit-addressable nature of the SCM. In order to add more layers, the idea is that additional word and bit lines are added, along with the cells in-between.", "Why does Kioxia think that 3D Stacked SCM isn’t the future? I’ll go straight to the graph in question.", "Here we have two lines showing relative cost per bit against the number of layers. Each line is normalized to a single layer of itself, not each other. The function that causes this graph is takes into account the number of layers (y-axis), the effective complexity of adding additional layers, the x-y area lost due to more complex control circuitry, and the yield lost by adding more layers. Putting numbers in spits out an effective cost-per-bit as the layers add up.", "Now, 3D NAND is a proven technology. We have seen 90+ layers from multiple vendors in the market, and no-one is denying that adding layers is an effective way to go here, as the area loss is near to zero and the yield loss is similarly extremely low. This is because some of the etch-and-fill steps in the manufacturing process can cover many layers at once.", "But for 3D Stacked SCM technologies, we still haven’t seen them expand beyond a single layer device in the market. Kioxia’s data shows that while its BiCS flash reduces down to an asymptotic value at cost per bit as we go past 10 layers, the company says that 3D Stacked SCM will at best only reduce to 60% of the cost per bit for a 4-5 layer device compared to a single layer – with the data rising from there. This is down to the increased cost per layer, the area loss required, and the yield decrease based on using complicated cell technologies that don’t have the benefit of decades of improvements. In order to build 3D Stacked memory, it's a painstaking process of layer upon layer, which leads to decreases in yield with each additional step.", "For anyone interested, the equation for this graph is as follows:", "Where n = the number of layers, C", " is the cost for the common layer, C", " is the cost per extra layer, A is the area penalty for adding a layer, and Y is the yield penalty for a single layer.", "So it should be stated that at the plenary talk, we were not able to take photographs of the slides being presented. I made a quick note of the graph and the formula, and cycled back to Kioxia with suggested numbers for each of these variables to recreate these graphs. They replied saying I was very close with the following:", "When putting numbers in, it was clear that Cf + Cv had to equal 1, and as a result we basically end up looking at the ratio of the cost of adding a single layer to the design compared to the common layer of a design. The term involving area and yield affects the upswing of the curve, and the ratio of these ends up important for when the minimum value is as well as the rate at which the curve rises.", "In the case of 3D SCM, the cost per bit at around 12 layers became the same as the cost per bit of a single layer, which is at the key of Kioxia’s commentary: if SCM was ever to hit the number of layers that NAND flash would, it would become prohibitively expensive (50x cost per bit of a single layer for a 64-layer SCM device).", "Now of course, if we were to take the side of 3D Stacked SCM vendors, they will likely point out that just because of the price predictions today of >4 stacked layers seem cost-prohibitive, it doesn’t take into account what potential advancements will happen for the technology in the future. The ability to offer both high-density DRAM at order-of-magnitude performance levels or extremely low latency storage in a single product indicates its utility, rather than a lack of optimization for one or the other.", "From what I’ve had the pleasure to work with, I can greatly see the benefit of SCM in the memory space – offering a super large pool of data to work from at a lower cost per GB than traditional DRAM, while also having a warranty that covers 100% access over the warranty period. As a storage medium, it offers an immediate fast access however the cost per GB is rather high. For storage at least, flash is going to be king of capacity for a long while yet."]},

All of Phison's competitors have decided to take a bit more time transitioning to PCIe 4.0 so that they can also switch from 28nm manufacturing to the 12nm FinFET process.

The ~3.5GB/s capacity of a PCIe 3.0 x4 or PCIe 4.0 x2 link is still plenty for all but the most high-end consumer SSDs. However, the lack of PCIe 4.0 support on Intel's platforms means even low-end NVMe SSD controllers are moving to support four lanes of PCIe 4.0, so that they won't end up running at PCIE 3.0 x2 on Intel systems.

(And also suggesting that the controller may be the bottleneck for sequential transfers more than the 3D XPoint memory itself.) For QoS, Micron is listing both read and write latencies of 8µs or less, slightly better than the 10µs that Intel's current Optane SSDs promise.", "The card Micron is showing off today is a full-height half-length PCIe x16 add-in card, so it should be able to reach full throughput even on PCIe 3.0 systems. Micron says the X100 will be in limited sampling to select customers sometime this quarter, so it's not going to be shaking up the storage market much in the immediate future but it is far enough past the vaporware stage that Micron should be able to deliver the rest of the specs soon—including the range of available capacities. Since Micron hasn't said anything about a second generation of 3D XPoint memory being ready, the density and costs of the X100 shouldn't be drastically different from Intel's Optane offerings."]},

None of their PCIe Gen4 SSDs are particularly close to volume production, so rather than share preliminary performance numbers Toshiba is talking more about which product segments will be migrating first and what other design changes are coming at the same time as the interface speed boost. Toshiba's perspective on final products and market readiness stands in contrast to the roadmaps from the SSD controller vendors that are racing to be the first ready with a full lineup of PCIe 4.0-capable controllers.", "Toshiba expects the server market to be the first segment to embrace PCIe 4.0. AMD has just launched their second-generation EPYC platform with a comparative wealth of PCIe 4.0 lanes, and companies like Broadcom and Microsemi are offering PCIe 4.0 switches and HBAs. The ecosystem is just about ready to support a large-scale transition from PCIe Gen3 to Gen4, and Toshiba is expecting mainstream adoption to begin next year. They are timing their first two Gen4 SSDs for 2020. The Toshiba CM6 enterprise NVMe SSD and the CD6 datacenter NVMe SSD are successors to the existing CM5 and CD5 respectively, with the CM6 offering some more advanced enterprise features like PCIe dual-port support.

Instead, Toshiba is choosing the U.3 standard for the near term. This is mechanically identical to the familiar 2.5 U.2 form factor, but U.3 changes up the pin assignments. U.2 and U.3 SSDs both use the same mechanical connector as SAS drives, but where U.2 puts PCIe pins in positions not used by SAS drives, U.3 drives are capable of operating with a PCIe link on the same pins that SAS drives use for their data link. The motivation behind this change is to simplify cabling and backplanes for tri-mode ports that can accept SATA, SAS or NVMe SSDs. Broadcom in particular has been selling tri-mode HBAs and RAID cards that support all three protocols, and the use of U.3 instead of U.2 makes it much easier to make full use of the flexibility of those host interfaces. U.2 drives won't work in U.3 drive bays, but U.3 drives are required to work with U.2 ports. Toshiba has enabled this by adding an extra set of PCIe PHYs to their SSD controllers rather than put switches on the SSD between the controller and connector. This avoids any potential damage to signal integrity that such switches might impose.", "The Toshiba CM5 is available in both 2.5 U.2 and PCIe add-in card form factors, but the latter is being dropped by the CM6 due to a perceived lack of demand or compelling use cases. The add-in card form factor was already a very small slice of the SSD market, and PCIe 4.0 allows products that were using a PCIe 3.0 x8 interface to drop back down the a four-lane connection as provided by U.2/U.3 ports. For products that were using the AIC form factor more for the sake of enabling higher SSD capacity than for the sake of a wider PCIe link, the EDSFF 1U Long Ruler form factor will be taking over eventually, but that may not happen for another product generation or two.", "Toshiba is currently working with their partners for testing and validation of the CM6 and CD6, with volume availability planned for 2020. Further down the road, Toshiba is also working on an XD6 replacement for their XD5. These are their more hyperscaler-oriented datacenter drives, with more of a focus on low power and latency compared to the CD and CM series focus on higher performance and more advanced features. The XD5 uses the M.2 22110 form factor. The XD6 will retain that option and may also be Toshiba's first SSD to use the EDSFF E1.S (1U Short) form factor. Datacenter M.2 drives need the advantages of EDSFF form factors a lot more than other existing form factors do, and across the industry as a whole it looks like the E1.S form factor will be the first EDSFF variant to go mainstream. Officially, the XD6 is being targeted for shipment after 2020.", "Even though there are a few PCIe Gen4 SSDs already available in the consumer segment, Toshiba is predicting that PCIe Gen4 will remain a niche enthusiast feature for a while longer. Since Toshiba's client SSD sales are almost exclusively to OEMs rather than direct to consumers in the form of retail products, they aren't under much pressure yet to switch these products over to PCIe Gen4 and haven't made any official statements about upcoming products for this segment.

After giving away some of their new Ironwolf 110 SSDs a couple of months back, this month the company has decided to up the ante. Rather than just giving away the SSDs, this time the company will be giving away a complete NAS setup, comprised of QNAP TS-932X-2G 9 bay NAS, as well as one of each of Seagate’s IronWolf Pro 16TB HDD and Ironwolf 110 240GB SSD.", "Starting things off, we have ", ", a business-class NAS. This is one of the company’s compact 9 bay NASes, sporting 5 3.5-inch SATA drive bays along with another 4 2.5-inch SATA bays. The NAS is designed particularly for tiered storage, with the 3.5-inch bays being ideal for HDDs, while the 2.5-inch bays can hold SSDs (or in a pinch, 2.5-inch HDDs). Under the hood, the 932X is based on a quad core ARM Cortex A57-based SoC, the Alpine AL-324, which runs at 1.7GHz. This specific model comes with 2GB of DDR4 pre-installed in the single SO-DIMM slot, though it can be upgraded.", "In terms of I/O, the NAS comes with a trio of USB 3.0 Type-A ports, among other things. But perhaps the most interesting feature here is the NAS’s Ethernet support: a pair of GigE RJ45 ports, along with a pair of 10GigE SFP+ ports. Owing to its business-focused design, QNAP has opted for SFP+ ports, which means that the NAS can be equipped with any of several different flavors of 10GigE depending on what kind of cabling you’d like to use. The one downside to this is that it means the ports aren’t actually usable without buying a transceiver, so there’s an additional cost (10GBASE-T transceivers are ~$50) before 10GigE is actual usable.", "Meanwhile from Seagate, we have a pair of IronWolf drives from them.

Designed house up to 4 NVMe SSDs, the card is essentially a multi-way M.2 adapter, allowing a PCIe 4.0 x16 slot to be used to drive four x4 SSDs. Fittingly, with so many high-end SSDs on a single board, the card also features an active cooling system to ensure that the drives run at consistent speeds even under high loads. Fully populated with PCIe 4.0 SSDs, the card is rated to provide up to a staggering 15 GB/s of throughput – at least, if you can come up with a workload that can saturate such a setup.", "GIGABYTE’s Aorus Gen4 AIC SSD 8 TB is a PCIe 4.0 x16 board with eight PCIe Gen 4 re-drivers. The card in turn carries four 2 TB M.2-2280 SSDs based on Phison’s PS5016-E16 controller, which remains the only client SSD controller with a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface. The card also features a sophisticated cooling system comprising of a large copper heatsink, a 5-cm ball bearing fan, and a baseplate, along with eight thermal sensors to monitor everything. That monitoring, in turn, is provided by the Aorus Storage Manager software, which can also configure the cooling on the card and supports three fan operating modes, including Silent, Balanced, and Performance.", "When running in RAID 0 mode, the Aorus Gen4 AIC SSD 8 TB offers up to 15 GB/s sequential read/write speeds, as well as 430K/440K read/write IOPS. It goes without saying that this is a throughput-focused card, as outside of the difficulty in even coming up with that many IOPS in a client workload, RAID modes don't really improve IOPS.", "While the sequential performance of the Aorus Gen4 AIC SSD 8 TB looks extremely attractive, there is a caveat. The only enthusiast-class PCIe Gen 4-supporting platform today is AMD’s Ryzen 3000, and these CPUs only support 24 PCIe 4.0 lanes: x16 for an add-in-card, x4 for an NVMe SSD, and x4 to connect to the chipset. As a result, to make full use of the card you have to give up a board's sole PCIe 4.0 x16 slot for the SSD, which makes this a niche product for systems that don't need a powerful dGPU. Otherwise, installing the drive into a PCIe x16 slot controlled by AMD’s X570 chipset would cause it to be bottlenecked by the PCIe 4.0 x4 link between the chipset and the CPU.", "That said, the Aorus Gen4 AIC SSD 8 TB can show itself in all the glory either in a workstation based on AMD’s EPYC 7000-series processor with up to 128 PCIe Gen 4 lanes, or, presumably, in a future high-end desktop based on next-generation AMD Threadripper CPU.", "Related Reading:", "Source: ", " (via ", ")"]},

Innogrit was founded in 2016 by storage industry veterans with the goal of developing storage technology to support AI and big data applications. We spoke with co-founder Dr. Zining Wu (formerly Marvell's CTO) about the company's planned product lineup, and he will be presenting more information next week in a keynote speech at Flash Memory Summit.", "Innogrit's long term goal is to go after the enterprise storage market, but they are starting small with a DRAMless client SSD controller, the IG5208 Shasta. This is already in mass production with full turnkey reference SSD designs available. It will be followed up incrementally larger controllers with more advanced feature sets: Shasta+, Rainier and Tacoma. With each iteration, Innogrit is increasing performance, adding more features and improving their LDPC error correction engine.", "The Shasta and Shasta+ controllers are both primarily targeting the client SSD market, and they are designed as low-cost mainstream solutions. Shasta has just two PCIe 3 lanes while Shasta+ has four lanes and consequently higher performance, but otherwise they are quite similar. Both are 28nm designs and use the NVMe Host Memory Buffer feature rather than including DRAM controllers. Both controllers are small enough to be packaged inside single-chip BGA SSDs, and Innogrit's reference designs for Shasta-based SSDs include the standard 11.5x13mm and 16x20mm BGA SSD footprints and a CFX card design. The improved ECC capabilities of Shasta+ will make it a better choice for QLC-based SSDs, but both controllers support the full range of SLC through QLC from multiple manufacturers.", "Because Shasta and Shasta+ are stepping stones toward the enterprise and datacenter markets, they include support for some features not commonly found on client SSDs, such as an Open-Channel SSD operating mode. End-to-end data path protection is included, with ECC on all the controller's SRAM buffers and on data stored in the Host Memory Buffer. Power management appropriate for client and embedded use is supported, with Shasta peaking at 0.9W and supporting idle states at 55mW and less than 1mW, while Shasta+ will peak at about 1.35W. The NVMe Boot Partition feature is also supported for embedded systems that don't include a separate boot ROM device.", "Innogrit's Rainier controller is a significant generational advance over the Shasta family, moving up to the high-end client and entry-level datacenter markets. Rainier switches to one of TSMC's 16/12nm FinFET processes, which Innogrit (and most other controller designers) sees as necessary for PCIe gen4 support with reasonable power consumption. Rainier has 8 NAND channels that can run at up to 1200MT/s, fast enough for any currently-available NAND. This allows for sequential read and write speeds of up to 7GB/s and 6.1GB/s respectively, more or less saturating the PCIe 4 x4 interface. Rainier adds enterprise-oriented features like multiple namespace support and SR-IOV virtualization, but client-oriented power management is still supported, with idle states for 50mW and less than 2mW.", "The most powerful controller on Innogrit's roadmap is Tacoma, which builds on Rainier by doubling the NAND channel count to 16 (bringing the maximum supported capacity up to 32TB), widening the DRAM interface to 72 bits (64b with ECC), and adding more high-end enterprise features. Sequential IO performance will be roughly the same as for Rainier but random IO gets a boost from the extra parallelism. The virtualization capabilities have been enhanced relative to Rainier and the NVMe Controller Memory Buffer feature is supported, which comes in handy for NVMe over Fabrics deployments. A special low-latency mode is introduced, which Innogrit will be demonstrating with Toshiba's XL-FLASH (their answer to Samsung's Z-NAND). Perhaps the most important feature of Tacoma is the addition of in-storage compute with a deep learning accelerator; more information about this will be shared next week during Innogrit's keynote presentation at Flash Memory Summit.", "Innogrit's business model will be similar to most other independent SSD controller vendors, offering SSD vendors a range of options from a basic SDK for custom firmware up to full turnkey SSD designs. They have several design wins with the Shasta family controllers and are already sampling the Rainier and Tacoma controllers."]},

All three controllers have four NAND channels, but the largest 88SS1321 that has the DRAM interface also has twice as many chip enables on the NAND channels and thus can support higher capacities than the DRAMless 88SS1322 and 88SS1323.", "The sequential IO performance of the new 4-channel controllers is only slightly better than Marvell's earlier 8-channel controller, and random IO has taken a step backward. Marvell isn't aiming to saturate a PCIe 4 x4 link, though the smallest 88SS1323 with only a PCIe 4 x2 link does hit the speeds we're used to seeing from PCIe 3 x4 SSDs.", "Instead, Marvel is touting that they have the most power-efficient PCIe Gen4-capable SSD controllers, addressing concerns raised by AMD's latest chipsets and the Phison E16 SSD controller about PCIe 4 being a power hog. Marvell's new DRAMless controllers run at less than 2W with a PCIe 4 x4 link active, which isn't much more than the NAND flash itself requires. This is made possible by Marvell's jump to 12nm fabrication, compared to 28nm that has been the standard for most NVMe controllers. Even though these controllers are using a relatively advanced fab process, Marvell says they will allow for very cost-effective SSDs, especially when used in DRAMless configurations.", "Aside from the faster PCIe and NAND interfaces, the new generation of controllers are architecturally similar to their predecessors, with a handful of Arm Cortex R5 CPU cores and the same fourth-generation LDPC engine used by last year's controllers from Marvell.", "Marvell is currently sampling the new controllers, and will be showing them off next week at Flash Memory Summit.", " ", " "]},

Their other product lines – in particular enterprise/datacenter SSDs – have been servicable, but haven't been able to crack the market as a whole.", "Still intent on slicing out a larger portion of the datacenter SSD market, Kingston has decided to raise their profile by introducing SSDs that are based around the needs of their existing DRAM customers. That means that the company's new DC500 family of SSDs is intended for second-tier cloud service providers and system integrators, rather than the top hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. This also means that the new drives are SATA SSDs, because in this market segment – which relies more heavily on commodity components and platforms than Open Compute Project-style thorough customization – there is still significant demand for SATA SSDs.", "Using NVMe SSDs adds to platform costs in the form of expensive PCIe switches and backplanes, the drives themselves are each more expensive than a SATA drive of the same capacity, and power efficiency is often better for SATA than NVMe. PCIe SSDs make it possible to cram a lot of storage performance into a smaller number of drives and servers, but where the emphasis is more on capacity and cost effectiveness, SATA still has a place.", "The SATA interface itself is stuck at 6Gbps, but the technology that goes into SATA SSDs continues to evolve with new generations of NAND flash memory and new SSD controllers. Kingston's new DC500 family of enterprise SATA SSDs are our first look at Phison's new S12 SSD controller (specifically, the S12DC variant), the replacement for the S10 that has been on the market for over five years. (S11 is Phison's current DRAMless SATA controller.) While consumer SATA SSD controllers have mostly dropped down to just four NAND channels, the S12DC still has eight channels, but more for the sake of supporting high capacities than for improving performance. The S12DC officially supports 8TB, but Kingston isn't pushing things that far yet. The S12DC controller is fabbed on a 28nm process and brings major improvements to the error correction capabilities including Phison's third-generation LDPC engine.", "The DC500 family uses Intel's 64-layer TLC NAND flash memory, a break from Kingston's usual preference for Toshiba NAND. 96/92-layer TLC has started to show up in the client/consumer SSD market, but it's still a bit early to be seeing it in this part of the enterprise storage market.", "The DC500 family includes two tiers: the DC500R for read-heavy workloads (endurance rating of 0.5 DWPD) and the DC500M for more mixed read/write workloads (endurance rating of 1.3 DWPD).

Micron still offers a 5 DWPD SATA model (5200 MAX) but most other brands now top out around 3 DWPD for SATA drives. Those 3 DWPD and higher drives only account for about 20% of the market, so Kingston isn't missing out on too many sales by only going up to 1.3 DWPD with the DC500 family.

For sequential IO, the -R and -M versions are rated to deliver essentially the same performance, bottlenecked by the SATA link. The same is true for random reads, but steady-state random write performance is limited by the flash itself and varies with drive capacity and spare area. The DC500M models all have higher random write performance than all of the DC500R models.", "Power consumption is rated at a modest 1.8 W for reads and a fairly typical 4.86 W for writes. Low-power idle states are usually not included on enterprise drives, so the DC500s are rated to idle at 1.56 W.", "The DC500R and DC500M both use the same plain metal case, but the PCBs inside have some minor layout changes due to the differences in overprovisioning. Our 3.84TB samples feature raw capacities of 4096GB for the DC500R and 5120GB for the DC500M, so the -R versions have comparable overprovisioning to consumer SSDs while the -M versions have about three times as much spare area. The extra flash on the DC500M also requires it to have more DRAM: 6GB instead of the 4GB found on the DC500R 3.84TB.", "Physically, the memory is laid out differently between the two drives. The 3.84TB DC500R has a total of 16 packages with 256GB each of NAND, and the 3.84TB DC500M uses 10 packages of 512GB each rather than mix packages of different capacities.

Apple's PCIe SSDs used a proprietary form factor rather than the M.2 standard that went on to become the standard for client PCIe SSDs. So even though Apple's machines from 2013 through at least 2016 (depending on the model) included the fastest storage that money could buy ", ", those systems have been left behind as the NVMe storage market has matured from an exotic high-end novelty into the technology that's rapidly displacing SATA for mainstream computing.", "This is where Mac accessory and upgrade specialist Other World Computing (OWC) comes in.

The Aura Pro X2 is sold either as a bare drive, or in an upgrade kit that includes an external USB enclosure for the Apple original SSDs it replaces.", "The Aura Pro X2 isn't OWC's first attempt to offer an upgrade for Apple PCIe SSDs, but it's the first one that does the job well. Their first Aura SSD hit the market back when Mac OS X didn't include a standard NVMe driver, so the Aura had to present a standard AHCI interface. Rather than use an outdated AHCI PCIe SSD controller comparable to the ones in the early Apple PCIe SSDs, OWC put two SATA SSD controllers and a RAID controller onto one card. This allowed OWC to provide a functional drop-in replacement that could offer higher capacities, but it was a big step backward in performance (and probably power efficiency, but we didn't get the chance to test it).", "Apple eventually added a standard NVMe driver to MacOS, albeit after retiring upgradable internal storage from almost all of their product line.

The Aura Pro X2 currently starts at 26¢/GB, when M.2 SSDs with the same hardware are retailing for just over half that price. The price disparity is even worse at 2TB, which may be the most important capacity for the Aura Pro X2 since Apple never offered a 2TB SSD in this form factor.", "", "OWC doesn't have a complete lock on this upgrade market. The Apple PCIe SSD form factor is a bit longer than M.2, so it's possible to use a standard M.2 NVMe SSD and a dirt-cheap passive adapter. In Apple's laptops, these adapters are just a hair too thick, so closing the machine back up completely leaves the bottom panel bulging slightly and puts pressure on the adapter and SSD connector. These connectors weren't designed to bear the weight of the machine, so there's some risk of a mechanical failure leading to an unreliable connection. However, I've been using one in my personal 13 MacBook Pro for several months with no trouble so far other than a bit of creaking in the bottom panel when there's too much pressure near the SSD.", "Since macOS has supported standard NVMe drives for over a year and a half, there's no need for the OWC Aura Pro X2's hardware to differ from typical M.2 SSDs in any way other than the physical form factor. The specifications are basically what we expect from a typical high-end M.2 NVMe SSD in today's market, but OWC's sequential IO ratings are a bit lower than the most optimistic numbers we see for M.2 drives. The 5-year warranty and ~0.3 DWPD endurance rating are normal for high-end drives. Aside from the form factor and price, the only thing that really stands out in the spec table is that OWC is using more overprovisioning than the the other SM2262EN drives we've encountered: 960GB for our review sample rather than the 1000GB or 1024GB usable capacities we've previously tested.", "The layout of the Aura Pro X2 is very similar to M.2 SSDs with the SM2262EN controller. Apple's form factor is the same 22mm width as M.2 SSDs, and the extra 9mm length doesn't provide enough space to move around the major components, though some of the smaller passives have been rearranged. We're still looking at a double-sided drive, with two NAND packages and one DRAM package on each side. The Apple original SSDs we have on hand are actually more crowded with four NAND packages on each side, but the 64Gb per-die capacity of the Samsung 19nm MLC Apple was using back then is a far cry from the 256Gb TLC dies that now dominate the market.", "As a Mac-specific SSD, the OWC Aura Pro X2 demands a different testing procedure from our usual mix of Windows and Linux based test. We've still run it through our usual tests by putting the Aura Pro X2 in an adapter that lets it fit in M.2 slots on our normal desktop testbeds. We've also ported our Linux-based synthetic tests over to macOS with a few changes, and tested the Aura Pro X2 in two different MacBook Pro machines.", "For those macOS tests, we're comparing against two Apple original SSDs and several current high-end M.2 NVMe SSDs used in an adapter. The Apple original SSDs are both Samsung designs, similar to their XP941 and SM951 OEM M.2 drives. The latter drive uses the same UBX controller as the Samsung 950 Pro, the first retail M.2 NVMe SSD, while the older Apple drive uses the UAX controller that only supports PCIe 2.0 speeds. Samsung is still using MLC NAND in their top of the line 970 PRO (more than two generations removed from the Apple SSDs), while the rest of the market has concluded that 3D TLC NAND is fast enough and much more affordable.", "The newer SSDs included in this review all have a capacity advantage over the 128GB and 512GB Apple SSDs we are comparing against. In general, larger drives are faster because they have more NAND flash memory dies to use in parallel. However, since the older Apple SSDs use NAND with a much lower per-die capacity, they aren't as handicapped as their total capacity might suggest. Most of the performance improvements the newer SSDs provide come from controller improvements and from using NAND that is fundamentally faster on a per-die basis."]},

The Essencore drive at the show however has one feature none of the other drives has.", "The Phison E16 controller is built to use either Toshiba NAND flash, Micron NAND flash, or SK Hynix NAND flash. All the designs we saw at Computex used one of the first two – no-one was willing to commit to SK Hynix NAND at this point. However, given that Essencore is a family brand of SK Hynix, it doesn’t take much to put two and two together. Given the specifications at the booth, it would appear that the Hynix NAND is still easily sufficient to hit the 4.8 GB/s limit of the E16 controller.", "Speaking with our PR rep at Essencore, it would appear that the company is still debating how and when to put a PCIe 4.0 SSD on the market, and if using the Phison E16 solution is the right idea. The company may wait until newer controllers are available before pursuing the product line. We await more information later in the year."]},
{"title": "The Intel Optane Memory H10 Review: QLC and Optane In One SSD", "paragraph": ["SSD caching has been around for a long time, as a way to reap many of the performance benefits of fast storage without completely abandoning the high capacity and lower prices of slower storage options. In recent years, the fast, small, expensive niche has been ruled by Intel's Optane products using their 3D XPoint non-volatile memory. Intel's third generation of Optane Memory SSD caching products has arrived, bringing the promise of Optane performance to a new product segment. The first Optane Memory products were tiny NVMe SSDs intended to accelerate access to larger slower SATA drives, especially mechanical hard drives. Intel is now supporting using Optane Memory SSDs to cache other NVMe SSDs, with an eye toward the combination of Optane and QLC NAND flash. They've put both types of SSD onto a single M.2 module to create the new Optane Memory H10.", "The Intel Optane Memory H10 allows Intel for the first time to put their Optane Memory caching solution into ultrabooks that only have room for one SSD, and have left SATA behind entirely. Squeezing two drives onto a single-sided 80mm long M.2 module is made possible in part by the high density of Intel's four bit per cell 3D QLC NAND flash memory. Intel's 660p QLC SSD has plenty of unused space on the 1TB and 512GB versions, and an Optane cache has great potential to offset the performance and endurance shortcomings of QLC NAND. Putting the two onto one module has some tradeoffs, but for the most part the design of the H10 is very straightforward.", "The Optane Memory H10 does not introduce any new ASICs or any hardware to make the Optane and QLC portions of the drive appear as a single device. The caching is managed entirely in software, and the host system accesses the Optane and QLC sides of the H10 independently. Each half of the drive has two PCIe lanes dedicated to it. Earlier Optane Memory SSDs have all been PCIe x2 devices so they aren't losing anything, but the Intel 660p uses a 4-lane Silicon Motion NVMe controller, which is now restricted to just two lanes. In practice, the 660p almost never needed more bandwidth than an x2 link can provide, so this isn't a significant bottleneck.", "With a slow QLC SSD and a fast Optane SSD on one device, Intel had to make judgement calls in determining the rated performance specifications. The larger two capacities of H10 are rated for sequential read speeds in excess of 2GB/s, reflecting how Intel's Optane Memory caching software can fetch data from both QLC and Optane portions of the H10 simultaneously. Writes can also be striped, but the maximum rating doesn't exceed any obvious limit for single-device performance. The random IO specs for the H10 fall between the performance of the existing Optane Memory and 660p SSDs, but are much closer to Optane performance. Intel's not trying to advertise a perfect cache hit rate, but they expect it to be pretty good for ordinary real-world usage.", "The Optane cache should help reduce the write burden that the QLC portion of the H10 has to bear, but Intel still rates the whole device for the same 0.16 drive writes per day that their 660p QLC SSDs are rated for.", "Intel's marketing photos of the Optane Memory H10 show it with a two-tone PCB to emphasize the dual nature of the drive, but in reality it's a solid color. The PCB layout is unique with two controllers and three kinds of memory, but it is also obviously reminiscent of the two discrete products it is based on. The QLC NAND half of the drive is closer to the M.2 connector and features the SM2263 controller and one package each of DRAM and NAND. The familiar Silicon Motion test/debug connections are placed at the boundary between the NAND half and the Optane half. That Optane half contains Intel's small Optane controller, a single package of 3D XPoint memory, and most of the power management components. Both the Intel SSD 660p and the earlier Optane Memory SSDs had very sparse PCBs; the Optane Memory H10 is crowded and may have the highest part count of any M.2 SSD on the market.", "On the surface, little has changed with the Optane Memory software; there's just more flexibility now in which devices can be selected to be cached. (Intel has also opened extended Optane Memory support to Pentium and Celeron branded processors on platforms that were already supported with Core processors.) When the boot volume is cached, Intel's software allows the user to specify files and applications that should be pinned to the cache and be immune from eviction. Other than this, there's no room for tweaking of the cache behavior.", "Some OEMs that sell systems equipped with Optane Memory have been advertising memory capacities as the sum of DRAM and Optane capacities, which might be reasonable if we were talking about Optane DC Persistent Memory modules that connect to the CPU's memory controller, but is very misleading when the Optane product in question is an SSD. Intel says to blame the OEMs for this misleading branding, but Intel's own Optane Memory software does the same thing.", "Initially, the Optane Memory H10 will be an OEM-only part, available to consumers only pre-installed in new systems—primarily notebooks. Intel is considering bringing the H10 to retail both as a standalone product and as part of a NUC kit, but they have not committed to plans for either. Their motherboard partners have been laying the groundwork for H10 support for almost a year, and many desktop 300-series motherboards already support the H10 with the latest publicly available firmware.", "Putting two PCIe devices on one M.2 card is novel to say the least. Intel has put two SSD controllers on one PCB before with high-end enterprise drives like the P3608 and P4608, but those drives use PCIe switch chips to split an x8 host connection into x4 for each of the two NVMe controllers on board. That approach leads to a 40W TDP for the entire card, which is not at all useful when trying to work within the constraints of a M.2 card.", "There are also several PCIe add-in cards that allow four M.2 PCIe SSDs to be connected through one PCIe x16 slot. A few of these cards also include PCIe switches, but most rely on the host system supporting PCIe port bifurcation to split a single x16 port into four independent x4 ports. Mainstream consumer CPUs usually don't support this, and are generally limited to x8+x4+x4 or just x8+x8 bifurcation, and only when the lanes are being re-routed to different slots to support multi-GPU use cases. Recent server and workstation CPUs are more likely to support bifurcation down to x4 ports, but motherboard support for enabling this functionality isn't universal.", "Even on CPUs where an x16 slot can be split into four x4 ports, further bifurcation down to x2 ports is seldom or never possible. The chips that do support operating a lot of PCIe lanes as narrow x2 or x1 ports are the southbridge/PCH chips on most motherboards. These tend to not support ports any wider than x4, because that's the normal width of the connection upstream to the CPU.", "Based on the above, we put theory to the test and tried the Optane Memory H10 with almost every PCIe 3.0 port we had on hand, using whatever adapters were necessary. Our results are summarized below:", "The Whiskey Lake notebook Intel provided for this review is of course fully compatible with the Optane Memory H10, and will be available for purchase in this configuration soon. Compatibility with older platforms and non-Intel platforms is mostly as expected, with only the NAND side of the H10 accessible—those motherboards don't expect to find two PCIe devices sharing a physical M.2 x4 slot, and aren't configured to detect and initialize both devices. There are a few notable exceptions:", "First, the H370 motherboard in our Coffee Lake system is supposed to fully support the H10, but GIGABYTE botched the firmware update that claims to have added H10 support: both the NAND and Optane portions of the H10 are accessible when using a M.2 slot that connects to the PCH, but it isn't possible to enable caching. There are plenty of 300-series motherboards that have successfully added H10 support, and I'm sure GIGABYTE will release a fixed firmware update for this particular board soon. Putting the H10 into a PCIe x16 slot that connects directly to the CPU does not provide access to the Optane side, reflecting the CPU's lack of support for PCIe port bifurcation down to x2+x2.", "The only modern AMD system we had on hand was a Threadripper/X399 motherboard. All of the PCIe and M.2 slots we tried led to the Optane side of the H10 being visible instead of the NAND side.", "We also connected the H10 through two different brands of PCIe 3.0 switch. Avago's PLX PEX8747 switch only provided access to the NAND side, which is to be expected since it only supports PCIe port bifurcation down to x4 ports. The Microsemi PFX PM8533 switch does claim to support bifurcation down to x2 and we were hoping it would enable access to both sides of the H10, but instead we only got access to the Optane half. The Microsemi switch and Threadripper motherboard may both be just a firmware update away from working with both halves of the H10, and earlier Intel PCH generations might also have that potential, but Intel won't be providing any such updates. Even if these platforms were able to access both halves of the H10, they would not be supported by Intel's Optane Memory caching drivers, but third-party caching software exists."]},

Following a very profitable boom year in 2018, it looks like the market is in a down swing, as an oversupply is starting to impact the bottom lines of memory makers. To stem any potential for significant losses or an outright market crash, three major manufacturers of NAND memory — Intel, Micron, and SK Hynix — have announced that they will be taking measures to address the oversupply, such as reducing flash production, cutting down wafer starts, and/or slowing down ramp ups of new fabs. Furthermore it is highly likely thr another major manufacturer, Samsung, will follow suit.", "The rapid transition to high-capacity 64-layer and 96-layer 3D NAND memory devices has enabled NAND flash manufacturers to increase their NAND supply (as measured in bits) and ultimately saturate the market with loads of flash memory. Meanwhile, demand for servers in the recent months has been weaker than expected, smartphone replacement cycles are getting longer, and other drivers of NAND demand have also disappointed. As a result, NAND supply has well exceeded demand, causing prices to fall by as much as 20% across multiple categories in Q1 2019, according to TrendForce. To ensure their short-term and long-term profitability, at various points in the last couple of months the three manufacturers have all announced that they are taking actions to minimize their exposure during this latest bust.", "Micron said back in March that it was carefully managing its NAND bit supply growth (to tackle oversupply at least partially) and started to decrease its total NAND wafer starts by roughly 5% by cutting its legacy nodes. The company did not indicate plans to shrink its NAND bit supply, but reducing production of memory using older process technologies will likely lower its costs.", "Meanwhile SK Hynix this week said that it had stopped production of 36-layer as well as 48-layer 3D NAND memory, which these days has a rather high per-bit cost relative to newer technologies. In the coming months the company plans to increase production of 72-layer 3D NAND and in the second half of the year it intends to release 96-layer 3D NAND solutions for the SSD and mobile markets. Furthermore, SK Hynix will slow down the ramp up of its M15 fab in Cheongju, South Korea. The company expects its NAND wafer output to decrease more than 10% compared to 2018. Just like Micron, SK Hynix does not seem to have plans to lower its NAND bit production, so it will still more memory than it did last year.", "Intel, which has traditionally concentrated on the enterprise part of the SSD market, has also announced this week it will reduce its NAND output in 2019. Intel did not elaborate whether it intended to reduce the number of wafer starts, or do something more radical. But regardless, the company continues to expect challenges with prices of NAND memory going forward, and is acting accordingly.", "Finally, while Samsung yet has to announce its Q1 2019 results, it has already warned investors that its profits for the quarter would be down 60% compared to Q1 2018. Analysts have been attributing this to multiple factors, including demand for flagship smartphones, lower prices of DRAM and NAND memory, and other weak markets. Given that the other major memory manufacturers are all taking steps to address the current oversupply, It is more than likely that Samsung will also adjust its NAND business this year; though how they'll do so remains to be seen.", "Related Reading:", "Sources: ", ", ", ", ", ", ", ", "]},

So now that we've completed some updates to our SSD testing workflow, we're going to do just that, and give you a quick peek into our 2019 SSD testing setup.", "As a bit of background to start things off, since December 2017, we have been using a ", " XLC Programmable Power Module (PPM) to supply and measure power to SSDs during most of our benchmark runs. The XLC module is Quarch's second-generation power module, and while capable, it does have a few limitations as far as our SSD testing goes. Most of which, as it turns out, have been addressed in the XLC's successor, the third-generation HD Programmable Power Module.", "So Quarch in turn has sent one of these new power modules our way, which we're using to upgrade our SSD testbed and refine our workflow. The newer power module allows us to take more accurate measurements of M.2 SSD power draw and gives us more flexibility in test configurations.", "At a high level, the purpose of using a programmable power module is to allow us to record the power consumption of SSDs in great detail, with the power module feeding any SSDs we're testing. Complicating matters just a tad, these power modules are a bit larger than a standard 5.25 optical drive and require their own AC wall power input, so they don't fit easily inside any of the systems we use for SSD testing. Instead, they feed power to SSDs through cables that connect to any of several power injection fixtures—Quarch provides fixtures for almost all SSD form factors and connectors, including the very new ", ". These power injection fixtures pass through any data signals untouched, but connect the SSD's power supply lines to the Quarch power module instead of the host computer's power supply.", "When it first launched, the HD Programmable Power Module added many convenience features over the XLC, but the core power supply and measurement capabilities we rely on were basically the same. Both modules provide two DC power rails: a 12V rail and one that can be configured for 3.3V or 5V depending on the type of drive being tested.", "The power modules have several analog to digital converters (ADCs) to simultaneously measure current and voltage on both rails, and there's an extra low-range mode for the current measurements that allows for accurate measurement of sub-milliamp current drawn by SSDs in extremely low-power idle states. The ADCs are sampling at 250kHz, so the power modules can record very short-lived spikes in power draw. This for example means that when testing a mechanical hard drive, it is easy to observe individual seek operations separately from the read or write operations that occur after the heads are in the right place. The measurement resolution and sampling rate both fall somewhere between the typical values for bench multimeters and oscilloscopes, and for this specialized use case a Quarch programmable power module is able to replace a very large pile of traditional electronics lab equipment.", "Last year, Quarch developed a hardware upgrade for the HD PPM to address a major limitation: When testing  M.2 SSDs, the power module has to supply 3.3V over a cable that's about two feet long. High-power M.2 SSDs can draw in excess of 3A of current, which leads to significant voltage drop along the cable—and SSDs typically only tolerate about a 5% drop below nominal voltage before they stop working. The power modules allow their output rails to be set above nominal voltage, but some M.2 PCIe SSDs still pushed the limits of the XLC module's current delivery capabilities. Quarch has now upgraded the HD module to support 5A continuous and up to 9.2A for short term (10 seconds). More importantly, the HD PPM now automatically adjusts its output voltage to compensate for voltage drop along the cable, so that it regulates the programed voltage measured at the drive instead of at the module's output connector.", "", "With the XLC power module, we were unable to feed high-performance M.2 PCIe SSDs 3.3V directly without running into problems, and instead we have been conducting performance testing with the drives mounted in a PCIe to M.2 adapter card that does its own 12V to 3.3V regulation. That adds some overhead to our power measurements, but this is easy to correct for after the fact. For idle power testing, voltage drop isn't a problem and we have always been using a direct 3.3V supply. The upgraded capabilities of the HD power module allow us to start using a direct 3.3V supply even during performance testing, and to use Quarch's M.2 power injection fixture to connect drives through the host system's M.2 slots instead of just through full-size PCIe card slots.", "", "The net impact of all of this is that we're now able to measure M.2 SSD power draw in a laptop computer (albeit with some extra cables hanging out the bottom).

DevSleep is generally impossible on desktops because it requires signaling through the SATA power connector rather than the data connector, and the HP Spectre x360 13t notebook we are using with the Optane Memory H10 is an NVMe-only system. The notebook market in general has reached a tipping point and OEMs are rapidly switching from SATA to NVMe, so SATA DevSleep is becoming less relevant.", "Going forward, all new M.2 SSDs will be tested with the HD Programmable Power Module for both idle and performance benchmarks. We will re-run performance testing for older M.2 drives as time permits, after updating all of the idle power measurements. On the software side, nothing is changing with our test procedures, and we will still be using the same Skylake desktop system for most of our tests except when testing drives that are not supported on that system (eg. the Optane Memory H10). We are currently not planning to make major changes to our SSD test procedures or host systems until it's time to move to PCIe 4.0."]},

Several years later, Intel has successfully commercialized 3D XPoint memory in a growing range of Optane products, but other alternative non-volatile memory technologies are still largely stuck in the lab.", "To compete against Intel's Optane SSDs, Samsung decided to exercise their lead in 3D NAND flash memory to produce a specialized high-performance variant, which they call Z-NAND. Fittingly, the first SSDs they use it in are branded Z-SSDs. The first two models to be released were the SZ983 and SZ985, which were both high-end drives specifically for datacenter customers.", "Meanwhile, with their major datacenter customers taken care of, Samsung is moving to make more of their enterprise and datacenter storage products available through retail distribution channels instead of just large-volume B2B sales. Spearheading that initiative, the SZ983 is now being sold to retail customers as the Samsung 983 ZET.", "Samsung originally announced Z-NAND in 2016, a year after 3D XPoint memory was announced and before any Optane products had shipped. Fundamentally, the first generation of Z-NAND is an effort to turn back the clock a bit; to step back from today's modern, high-density, (relatively) high-latency Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and back to simpler Single Level Cell (SLC) designs.", "SLC designs are relatively straightforward: since they only need to store a single bit of data per cell, the cell only needs to be in one of two voltage states. And this makes them both faster to read and faster to write – sometimes immensely so. The tradeoff is that they offer less density per cell – one-half or one-third as much data as the equivalent MLC or TLC NAND – and therefore a higher cost per bit overall. This has lead to the rapid adoption of MLC and then TLC, which for most use cases is plenty sufficient in terms of performance while also offering great capacity.", "However there are markets and use cases where absolute speed (and not capacity) is king, and this is where a SLC-based storage solution can provide much better real-world performance; enough so to justify the higher per-bit cost. And it's this market that Intel and Samsung have been exploiting with their 3D XPoint and Z-NAND products respectively.", "Adding an extra wrinkle to all of this is that Samsung's Z-NAND isn't ", " SLC NAND; if simply operating existing NAND as SLC was all there is to Z-NAND, then we would also expect Toshiba, WD, SK Hynix to have also delivered their competitors by now. Instead, Samsung has taken additional steps to further improve their SLC-based Z-NAND. We'll go into greater detail on this on the next page, but one of the big changes here was lowering the read and program times of the NAND, which further improves its read/write performance. This is important for Samsung both to give them an edge over the aforementioned competition, but also to ensure Z-NAND is competitive with 3D XPoint, which has proven to be no slouch in this area.", "On paper then, Samsung's Z-NAND looks plenty fast for the kinds of workloads and markets Samsung is chasing. Now it comes to Samsung's 983 ZET to deliver on those ambitions.", "The Samsung 983 ZET uses the same Phoenix controller that we are familiar with from their TLC-based 983 DCT and the 970 family of consumer NVMe SSDs. Eight channels makes for a high-end controller in the consumer market, but this is more of an entry-level controller in the datacenter space—the other flash-based SSDs we're comparing against have more powerful 12 or 16 channel controllers.", "The 983 ZET is available in just two capacities, both using a PCIe add-in card form factor. Samsung has demonstrated a M.2 Z-SSD and this controller is used in several other M.2 and U.2 drives, but the Z-SSDs are a relatively low-volume product and this retail channel version is even more of a niche product, so the limited range of SKUs makes sense.", "The sequential read and write specs for the 983 ZET are typical for high-end NVMe drives with PCIe 3 x4 interfaces, but it's uncommon to see these speeds at such low capacities: the small per-die capacity of Samsung's Z-NAND gives the 480GB 983 DCT as much parallelism to work with as a 2TB TLC drive. The random read performance of 750k IOPS is impressive for a SSD of any capacity, and while it isn't entirely unprecedented, it is significantly higher than the 550k IOPS that Intel's Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for.", "The random write specs bring the first difference in performance between the two capacities of the 983 ZET, and a stark reminder that we're still dealing with some of the limitations of flash memory. The steady-state random write performance is just 60k to 75k IOPS, an order of magnitude lower than the random read performance. Intel's Optane SSDs are only slightly slower for random writes than random reads, so the 983 ZET won't be able to come close to matching Optane performance on workloads that include a significant quantity of random writes.", "Write endurance for the 983 ZET also falls short of the bar set by Intel's Optane SSDs, with 8.5 DWPD for the 480GB 983 ZET and 10 DWPD for the 960 GB model, while the Optane SSD debuted with a 30 DWPD rating that has since been increased to 60 DWPD.", "This review builds on our recent ", ", and follows the same format and test procedures.

Silicon Power is unusual among SSD brands for using controllers and reference designs from both Silicon Motion and Phison; most brands that use turnkey drive solutions are exclusive partners with just one of those two controller vendors. For their NVMe drives, Silicon Power is so far using Phison's second-generation NVMe controllers, starting last year with the P32A80 based on the Phison E8T DRAMless controller, and now followed up by the P34A80 high-end drive based on the Phison E12.", "We previewed the Phison E12 controller solution with a review of an engineering sample before retail products were available, and later tested the Corsair Force Series MP510. Based on that, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from the P34A80, but there are two potentially significant changes. First, the Silicon Power drive is configured with a larger usable capacity and thus smaller spare area than the Corsair drive: 1024GB instead of 960GB, while both drives have the same raw amount of flash memory onboard. Reserving more spare area is usually done to improve sustained performance on write-heavy workloads and to reduce worst-case write amplification and thus increase a drive's write endurance. The Silicon Power P34A80 may thus be at a disadvantage for the tests in our suite that measure performance of a completely full drive.", "Second, the Silicon Power drive ships with newer firmware than we have previously tested: the Corsair MP510 was running version ECFM11.0 while the P34A80 is running ECFM12.1. We typically see many firmware versions for each Phison SSD controller. For the S10 SATA controller, quite a few of these revisions were necessary to support new NAND flash memory that was introduced over the course of the controller's long lifespan. For the E7—Phison's first NVMe controller—we saw at least four different firmware versions in shipping retail products, but ultimately none of them were able to extract enough performance to make the controller competitive against other high-end NVMe drives of the time. The Phison E12 launched as a serious contender, so there is much less need for tweaked firmware, but at the same time we have seen other controller hardware provide better performance when paired with the same Toshiba/SanDisk 64L TLC—most notably from Western Digital's in-house controller used in the WD Black product line.", "Not all vendors of Phison SSDs are good about providing firmware updates. Silicon Power's current firmware updater is a year old, but they haven't yet needed to provide a firmware update for their NVMe drives. Corsair was much quicker to market with their Phison E12 drive, but they have not yet packaged the 12.1 firmware for their customers. MyDigitalSSD was another early adopter of the E12 controller with their BPX Pro, which was the first retail product to get the 12.1 firmware update.", "Silicon Power provides only the most basic specifications for the P34A80, lacking any numbers for random IO performance, power consumption, and write endurance. The sequential IO performance numbers aren't broken down by capacity, but are a bit conservative compared to what other brands advertise for their 1TB Phison E12 drives.", "Turning to the drive itself, we find no surprises under the sticker. The Toshiba 64L 3D TLC is by now very familiar, and the PCB layout is only slightly revised from the first Phison E12 reference design we tested. The drive is double-sided even at lower capacities due to the presence of some passive components on the back of the card in addition to DRAM and NAND.", "The closest point of comparison for the Silicon Power P34A80 is the Corsair Force Series MP510, with identical hardware but older firmware and configured for a lower usable.

The Crucial MX series switched over to using Silicon Motion controllers with the MX500, featuring 64L 3D TLC. The Micron 1100 stuck around and occasionally made an impact on the retail market as a cheaper alternative available through grey-market resellers.", "The Micron 1300 leapfrogs the Crucial MX series by adopting 96L TLC, but otherwise little has changed from the 1100 series—it's still using Marvell controllers and provides the same feature set including optional TCG Opal encryption support and partial power loss protection.", "Since there's hardly any room for performance improvement behind a 6Gbps SATA link, Micron is primarily touting improved pricing and power efficiency for the 1300 SSD, though neither is quantified all that well by their press release. We found Micron's 32L 3D NAND to be consistently one of the slowest 3D flash memories ever shipped, so it's likely that the Micron 1300 with 96L NAND does provide a boost to performance at low queue depths even if the peak performance is largely unchanged.", "The Micron 1300 does not expand the range of available capacities: up to 2TB for 2.5 drives, and up to 1TB for M.2 SATA drives. Micron's datacenter SATA drives have hit 8TB using the same Marvell controllers, but the mainstream client SSD market doesn't have much demand for 4TB or 8TB drives yet.", "The write endurance ratings at the higher capacities are rather disappointing, with both 1TB and 2TB models rated for the same 400TB total endurance. Micron is reportedly already selling 96L TLC in the recently introduced 960GB Crucial BX500, so they shouldn't need to use the 1300 to unload low-grade 96L NAND.

Subverting this trend, however, the second-tier brands for the consumer and enterprise markets have very little overlap. This occurs despite the fact that the business models between the second-tier brands are actually quite similar. Either way, second-tier fabless SSD manufacturers for both markets base their businesses around buying NAND and SSD controllers from higher tier providers, build their own drive around those components. With drives based on commodity hardware, these fabless firms rely on custom firmware to differentiate their products.", "A prime example of one of these fabless companies – and the subject of today's review – is Beijing-based Memblaze. The company has made a name for itself in the enterprise space over several generations of high-end NVMe SSDs, starting in 2015 with their PBlaze4. In 2017 they released the first round of PBlaze5 SSDs, which moved to Micron's first-generation 3D TLC NAND.", "Most recently, late last year a new generation of PBlaze5 SSDs with Micron's 64-layer 3D TLC began to arrive. Today we're looking at the flagship from this latest generation, the PBlaze5 C916 6.4TB SSD. In addition to its large capacity, this drive features a PCIe 3.0 x8 interface that allows for speeds in excess of 4GB/s, and a high write endurance rating that makes it suitable for a broad range of workloads. The only way to get significantly higher performance or endurance from a single SSD is to switch to something that uses specialized low-latency memory like Intel's 3D XPoint, but their Optane SSDs only offer a fraction of the capacity.", "The PBlaze5 family of enterprise SSDs are all relatively high-end, but the product line has broadened to include quite a few different models. The models that start with C are PCIe add-in cards, with PCIe 3.0 x8 interfaces that allow for higher throughput than the PCIe x4 links that most NVMe SSDs are limited to. The models that start with D are U.2 drives that support operation as either a PCIe x4 device or dual-port x2+x2 for high availability configurations. Memblaze offers models in two endurance tiers: 1 or 3 drive writes per day, reflecting the trend away from 5+ DWPD models as capacities have grown and alternatives like 3D XPoint and Z-NAND have arrived to serve the most write-intensive workloads.", "The add-in card models are more performance-focused, while the U.2 lineup includes both the highest capacities (currently 15.36 TB), as well as some models designed for lower power and capacities so that a thinner 7mm U.2 case can be used.", "Most of the PBlaze5 family uses the Microsemi (formerly PMC-Sierra) Flashtec NVMe2016 controller, one of the most powerful SSD currently controllers on the market.

Instead, the competition for the NVMe2016 comes from the largest in-house controllers developed by companies like Samsung, Intel and Toshiba, as well as Xilinx FPGAs that are used to implement custom controller architectures for other vendors. All of these controller solutions are strictly for the enterprise/datacenter market, and are unsuitable for consumer SSDs: the pin count necessary for 16 or more NAND channels makes these controllers too big to fit on M.2 cards, and they are too power-hungry for notebooks.", "Micron's 64-layer 3D TLC NAND has consistently proven to offer higher performance than their first-generation 32L TLC, but Memblaze isn't advertising any big performance increases over the earlier PBlaze5 SSDs. Instead, they have brought the overprovisioning ratios back down to fairly normal levels after the 32L PBlaze5 drives. Those drives were rated for 3 DWPD, and as a result kept almost 40% of their raw flash capacity as spare area. The PBlaze C916 with 64L TLC, on the other hand, reserves only about 27% of the flash as spare and suffers only a slight penalty to steady-state write speeds, and no penalty to rated endurance. (For comparison, consumer SSDs generally reserve 7-12% of their raw capacity for metadata and spare area, and are usually rated for no more than about 1 DWPD.)", "Our 6.4TB PBlaze5 C916 sample features a total of 8TiB of NAND flash in 32 packages each containing four 512Gb dies. This makes for a fairly full PCB, with 16 packages each on the front and back. There is also 9GB of DDR4 DRAM on board, providing the usual 1GB per TB, plus ECC protection for the DRAM.", "Diving into the performance specs for the PBlaze5 C916 compared to its immediate predecessor, we see that the 6.4TB C916 should mostly match the fastest 4TB C900 model, but steady-state random write performance is rated to be about 10% slower. The smaller 3.2TB C916 shows more significant performance drops compared to the 3.2TB C900, but in terms of cost it is better viewed as a replacement for the old 2TB model. Random read and write latencies are rated to be a few microseconds faster on the C916 with 64L TLC than the C900 with 32L TLC.", "The C916 is rated for the same 7W idle and 25W maximum power draw as the earlier PBlaze5 SSD. However, Memblaze has made a few changes to the power management features. The 900 series included power states to limit the drive to 20W or 15W, but the 916 can be throttled all the way down to 10W and provides a total of 16 power states to allow for the limit to be tuned in 1W increments between 10W and 25W. We've never encountered a NVMe SSD with this many power states before, and it seems to be a bit excessive.", "Ultimately the lower power states don't make much sense for the C916 because most PCIe x8 slots have no trouble delivering 25W and enough airflow to cool the drive. However, the D916 in the U.2 form factor is harder to cool, and the configurable power limit may come in handy for some systems. So for this review, the C916 was run through the test suite twice: once with the default 25W power state, and once in the lowest 10W limit state to see what workloads are affected and how the drive's QoS holds up during throttling.", "In addition to its flexible power management, the PBlaze5 supports several of the more advanced NVMe features that are often left out on entry-level enterprise drives. The drive supports 128 NVMe queues, so all but the largest servers will be able to assign one queue to each CPU core, allowing IO to be performed without core to core locking or synchronization. Many older enterprise NVMe SSDs we have tested are limited to 32 queues, which is less than optimal for our 36-core testbed. To complement the dual-port capability of the U.2 version, the firmware supports multipath IO, multiple namespaces, and reservations to coordinate access to namespaces between different hosts connected to the same PCIe fabric.

{"title": "The Reality of SSD Capacity: No-One Wants Over 16TB Per Drive", "paragraph": ["One of the expanding elements of the storage business is that the capacity per drive has been ever increasing. Spinning hard-disk drives are approaching 20 TB soon, while solid state storage can vary from 4TB to 16TB or even more, if you’re willing to entertain an exotic implementation. Today at the Data Centre World conference in London, I was quite surprised to hear that due to managed risk, we’re unlikely to see much demand for drives over 16TB.", "Speaking with a few individuals at the show about expanding capacities, storage customers that need high density are starting to discuss maximum drive size requirements based on their implementation needs. One message starting to come through is that storage deployments are looking at managing risk with drive size – sure, a large capacity drive allows for high-density, but in a drive failure of a large drive means a lot of data is going to be lost.", "If we consider how data is used in the datacentre, there are several levels regarding how often the data is used. Long-term storage, known as cold storage, is accessed very infrequently and occupied with mechanical hard-drives with long-time data retention. A large drive failure at this level might lose substantial archival data, or require long build times. More regularly accessed storage, or nearline storage / warm storage, is accessed frequently but is often used as a localised cache from the long-term storage. For this case, imagine Netflix storing a good amount of its back-catalogue for users to access – a loss of a drive here requires accessing colder storage, and the rebuild times come in to play. For hot storage, the storage that has constant read/write access, we’re often dealing with DRAM or large database work with many operations per second. This is where a drive failure and rebuild can result in critical issues with server uptime and availability.", "Ultimately the size of the drive and the failure rate leads to element of risks and downtime, and aside from engineering more reliant drives, the other variable for risk management is drive size. 16TB, based on the conversations I’ve had today, seems to be that inflection point; no-one wants to lose 16TB of data in one go, regardless of how often it is accessed, or how well a storage array has additional failover metrics.", "I was told that sure, drives above 16TB do exist in the market, however aside from niche applications (such as risk is an acceptable factor for higher density), volumes are low. This inflection point, one would imagine, is subject to change based on how the nature of data and data analytics will change over time.

Of course, 16 TB per drive puts no limits on the number of drives per system – we have seen 1U units with 36 of these drives in the past, and Intel has been promoting up to 1 PB in a 1U form factor. It is worth noting that the market for 8 TB SATA SSDs is relatively small - no-one wants to rebuild that large a drive at 500 MB/s, which would take a minimum of 4.44 hours, bringing server uptime down to 99.95% rather than the 99.999% metric (5m22 per year)."]},

The first WD Blue SSD introduced in 2016 used planar TLC NAND and a Marvell controller with the usual amount of DRAM for a mainstream SSD. The next year, the WD Blue was updated with 3D TLC NAND that kept it competitive with the Crucial MX series and Samsung 850 EVO. 2018 passed with no changes to the WD Blue hardware, but prices were slashed to keep up with the rest of the industry: the 1TB drive that debuted with a MSRP of $310 is now selling for $120.", "SanDisk's 64-layer 3D TLC NAND is nearing the end of its product cycle, but they and other NAND flash manufacturers aren't in a hurry to switch over to 96L NAND, so it's not quite time for another straightforward refresh of the WD Blue.

Now that the WD Black is well-established as a high-end NVMe product, there's room for an entry-level NVMe SSD, and it will be the new WD Blue SN500.

The high-end version of this controller architecture has proven to be very competitive (especially for a first-generation product), but so far we have only the SN500's spec sheet by which to judge the low-end controller.", "High-end client/consumer NVMe SSDs all use PCIe 3.0 x4 interfaces, but the entry-level NVMe market is split between four-lane and two-lane controllers. Two-lane controllers are generally cheaper and their smaller size makes them attractive for small form factor devices that can't fit a full 22x80mm M.2 card. The WD SN520 is a 22x30mm design that is also available in 42mm and 80mm card lengths, but the retail WD Blue SN500 will only be sold in the 80mm length that is most common for consumer M.2 drives.", "The switch from SATA to NVMe means the new WD Blue SN500 will offer much higher peak performance, but the use of a DRAMless controller means there may be some corner cases where heavy workloads show little improvement or even regress in performance. The SN500's controller does not use the NVMe Host Memory Buffer, but does include an undisclosed amount of memory on-board that serves a similar purpose. This means that omitting the external DRAM from the drive should not have as severe a performance impact as it does for DRAMless SATA drives like the WD Green SSD.", "Even if the new WD Blue SN500 succeeds at offering far better performance than the current WD Blue SATA SSD, it will still be a big step backward in terms of capacity: the SATA product line ranges from 250GB to 2TB, but the SN500 will only be offered in 250GB and 500GB capacities. We hope that Western Digital has an upgraded WD Green in the works to keep affordable 1TB+ drives in their portfolio.", "The MSRPs for the WD Blue SN500 are a few dollars higher than current retail pricing for the mainstream SATA SSDs they are intended to succeed. Western Digital has not mentioned when the SN500 will hit the shelves, but there will probably not be much delay after today's announcement, since this hardware has been shipping to OEMs for a year already."]},

Now Seagate is using ", " to enter the high-end market segment with a lineup of M.2 NVMe SSDs: the BarraCuda 510 and FireCuda 510.", "At first glance, it may seem silly for Seagate to use two different names to refer to what are essentially two halves of the same product line. However, the current state of high-end consumer NVMe SSDs is that only the largest models are able to reach the impressive speeds that are closing in on the limits of a PCIe 3 x4 link. Smaller models are held back by having too few NAND flash memory dies for the SSD controller to access in parallel. This has always been true to some extent, but now that each 3D TLC die is providing either 256Gb or 512Gb, the small-drive performance penalty is affecting rather mainstream drive capacity points. For this reason, it makes sense for Seagate to reserve their gaming/enthusiast-oriented FireCuda branding for the 1TB and 2TB models, while their more mainstream BarraCuda branding is applied to the 256GB and 512GB models.", "Aside from capacity, there are a few minor differences between the BarraCuda 510 and the FireCuda 510. The BarraCuda 510 models have less overprovisioning, with power of two capacities of 256GB and 512GB while the FireCuda 510 is 1000 or 2000 GB. This difference also affects the write endurance rating, which is 0.3 drive writes per day for the BarraCuda 510 and 0.5 drive writes per day for the FireCuda 510; both figures are more typical of mainstream consumer SSDs rather than high-end models. The lower capacity of the BarraCuda 510 models allows them to be single-sided M.2 cards, which helps fit them into thinner notebook systems. The BarraCuda 510 will also be available in versions with or without TCG Opal encryption support, while the FireCuda will only ship in non-encrypting form.", "The two drives are still essentially the reference hardware designs from Phison, and we expect real-world performance to be in line with other drives based on the same platform, such as the ", " or the MyDigitalSSD BPX Pro. Seagate has not announced pricing for the new models, which will ship in March 2019. Seagate's pricing on the BarraCuda SATA SSD has been nothing special but still falls within the reasonable range for a mainstream drive. With the new NVMe models, we hope to see Seagate be a little more aggressive in order to reestablish their brand in an era where consumers no longer have much need for mechanical hard drives.", "Source: Seagate"]},

The Toshiba BG4 is a significant upgrade over ", ": Toshiba's new 96-layer 3D TLC replaces their 64-layer NAND, allowing for higher capacities and lower power consumption. The PCIe 3 x2 controller used in the BG2 and BG3 is replaced by a new controller supporting PCIe 3 x4, opening the door to much higher sequential I/O performance.", "The BG4 is still a DRAMless SSD that relies on the NVMe Host Memory Buffer (HMB) feature to mitigate the performance penalties that a DRAMless drive otherwise suffers from. Toshiba has enhanced their use of HMB with the addition of parity checking for data the SSD stores in host DRAM, providing an extra layer of data protection even when the host system does not use ECC memory. The BG4's firmware has also been tweaked to expand the range of user data mapping information that can be cached in the host memory buffer, improving performance for use cases like copying large files. These changes mean that the BG4 will ask to use a larger chunk of host memory to accelerate its operation, but the requested HMB size is still less than 100MB. Other firmware changes have focused on improving random I/O performance and reducing the impact of background flash management on interactive performance. Preliminary performance numbers from Toshiba indicate that random write performance has almost doubled, and random read performance is well over twice as fast as the BG3.", "The change to a wider PCIe x4 host interface does not require the BG4 to adopt a larger BGA package size than its predecessors, but the version that is mounted on a removable M.2 2230 card now uses type-M keying instead of the B+M keying typically used for M.2 SATA and PCIe x2 SSDs. The switch to 96L 3D TLC with a higher per-die capacity has allowed some drive capacities to be thinner (1.3mm vs 1.5mm for the 512GB model), and has allowed a 1TB model to be introduced to the BG series for the first time. Toshiba was the first to ship SSDs with 96L NAND with last year's ", ", and it looks like the BG4 will be the second 96L SSD to start shipping.", "Toshiba's BG series has always been an entry-level NVMe SSD product for the OEM market, so it has largely escaped attention from consumers. Even the BG3's retail derivative ", " failed to have much impact due to a combination of higher than SATA prices, limited availability, and strong competition from the cheapest high-end NVMe SSDs that have overshadowed all attempts to establish a low-end NVMe market segment. However, the BG series has been growing in popularity with OEMs as an attractive alternative to small and slow eMMC for ultra-mobile devices. More recently, the BG3 has even been used in desktop systems as one of the cheapest ways for OEMs to be able to advertise NVMe storage. The BG4 is likely to see even broader adoption thanks to the higher performance, wider capacity range, and pricing that Toshiba says will be directly competing against SATA SSDs.", "The Toshiba BG4 is currently sampling to select OEMs for qualification. Toshiba expects to provide review samples around the end of Q1, along with broader availability in Q2. A retail version has not been announced, but the BG4 seems positioned to fare better in the retail market than the BG3-based RC100, so we would not be surprised to see an RC200 by the end of the year."]},

The Optane SSD 815P will be available in the same 58GB and 118GB capacities as the 800P.", "It appears that Intel is continuing with the rather confusing mismatch of advertised capacities between the Optane Memory and Optane SSD products. In reality, the Optane Memory 64GB and Optane SSD 58GB products have the exact same usable capacity, and the same will hold true for the 128GB vs 118GB. The smaller advertised capacities are more in line with how SSD vendors traditionally relate claimed GB to actual usable capacity, while the Optane Memory parts are advertising the nominal raw capacity of their 3D XPoint memory without reflecting space used for error correction or spare area for defect and wear management.", "The system requirements for the above Optane products are unchanged from their predecessors. Optane Memory caching requires a Kaby Lake or newer platform and the use of Intel's Optane Memory storage drivers for Windows. Otherwise, both the M15 and 815P are standard NVMe SSDs that can be used as regular data or boot drives in any system that supports flash-based NVMe SSDs.", "The third new Optane product is by far the most interesting: the Optane Memory H10 with Solid State Storage, codenamed Teton Glacier. Where previous Optane Memory products have been intended to serve as a cache in front of a mechanical hard drive, the H10 is Optane caching for QLC NAND, with both 3D XPoint and flash memory on the same M.2 module.

The first half of the board appears to contain the same Silicon Motion SM2263 controller used on the 660p, and one package each of DRAM and QLC NAND. The second half of the board looks like an existing Optane Memory module, with its own controller and 3D XPoint memory packages. We're not sure if this photo is an accurate representation of the real product, but it indicates that two PCIe lanes are routed to the SM2263 controller and two to the Optane controller. This suggests the Optane Memory H10 will appear to the host system as two different NVMe SSDs, and will likely require PCIe port bifurcation support to operate a PCIe x4 M.2 slot as two PCIe x2 links. This could potentially limit compatibility to M.2 slots that use PCIe lanes provided by the PCH. Officially, the Optane Memory H10 will require a Whiskey Lake or Coffee Lake platform. Unofficially, this may be the first Optane product that doesn't work out of the box as a plain NVMe SSD on any platform that supports NVMe. The dual-controller nature of the H10 means that the SSD caching functionality still depends on driver software, and is not managed transparently by the SSD itself. Intel will have to develop a unified 3D XPoint+3D NAND controller to pull that off.", "Intel has not formally announced the M15 or 815P, but they have put up a ", ". The Optane Memory H10 is planned for release in Q2 2019 with OEM systems from the usual suspects: Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, ASUS, and unspecified others.

Starting this week, the 5210 ION is getting a broad release that will include sales through online retailers. This means that we finally have concrete detailed specifications and prices for the 5210.", "As originally announced, the 5210 ION is a fairly straightforward adaptation of the 5200 series TLC-based enterprise SATA SSDs to use Micron's new QLC NAND. The controller and most of the firmware are the same, and the change in flash memory brings lower cost, write endurance and performance. We now have a clear idea of just how big an impact the switch to QLC NAND makes on those specifications.", "Micron's primary goal with the 5210 ION is to expand the market for their enterprise SSDs. Micron does expect some customers to replace some of their TLC-based enterprise SSDs with QLC drives like the 5210 ION, but they're more interested in going after the remaining market for 10k RPM hard drives. Micron believes that with the 5210 they finally have a SSD that is cost-competitive with high-end hard drives, while offering higher performance, density, and power efficiency. Write speeds are the biggest weakness of QLC NAND, but even the smallest, slowest 5210 model can sustain sequential writes at least as fast as a 10k RPM hard drive.", "However, the 5210 has already proven to have broader appeal, and Micron has some large customers that are deploying it as replacements for 7200RPM hard drives or client TLC SSDs that were being used in datacenters. With a price similar to consumer TLC drives but firmware tuned for enterprise workloads, the 2TB 5210 is being rolled out to replace 1TB consumer SSDs in service with a major streaming media CDN. Serving up streaming video is an appropriately read-heavy, mostly sequential workload that allows the 5210 to saturate the SATA link as well as any drive, but with more consistent latency than client/consumer SSDs offer.", "Micron also cites a system builder of servers for machine learning is migrating from 8+TB 7200 RPM to the 8TB Micron 5210 ION for storing the massive datasets involved. The 5210 is quite a bit more expensive than the hard drives, but the hard drives have been a serious bottleneck. The higher performance of the 5210 allows these systems to perform tasks like image classification 8x faster, greatly improving the utilization of the expensive compute hardware in those machines and lowering the total cost of ownership. Machine learning can be an extremely read-heavy workload for inference tasks when a large model is consulted repeatedly and only occasionally updated.", "With the 5210 ION, Micron has adopted a workload-dependent write endurance rating system. The same drive can be rated for anywhere from 0.05 drive writes per day up to 0.8 drive writes per day depending on how much of the data written is sequential vs random, and whether it is small 4kB random writes or larger block sizes. By contrast, their Crucial P1 consumer QLC SSD still gets a single number rating of 0.1 DWPD. By giving a wide range of endurance ratings, Micron avoids having to label the 5210 with a single conservative rating that would make it look particularly fragile compared to TLC-based SSDs. It also encourages their customers to be more aware of the details of their workload when shopping for storage. A gradual increase in that kind of awareness has been an important enabler for the transition from MLC to TLC, and is the main reason for the decline of enterprise SSDs with 10+ DWPD endurance ratings. (Micron claims that last year, 75% of all enterprise SSDs sold were rated for 1 DWPD or less, and that percentage will continue to grow.)", "The patterns in the write endurance ratings are not completely uniform across the product line. All three capacities top out at 0.8 DWPD for 100% sequential 128kB writes, and are rated for 0.2 DWPD for 16kB random writes. When random writes of 4kB or 8kB are involved, the larger models have lower DWPD ratings than the 2TB model, possibly reflecting differences in how the flash translation layer is tuned for different drive capacities. The worst case is for 100% 4kB random writes, where the 2TB model is still rated for 0.2 DWPD but the 8TB model is rated for just 0.05 DWPD—the larger drive can't actually handle more total TB of 4k random writes.", "Micron is pitching the 5210 as best suited for workloads that are at least 70% sequential for their writes, which yields endurance ratings of at least 0.27–0.56 DWPD depending on drive capacity. There are plenty of datacenter workloads that fall within this range, and in particular, workloads that hard drives (10k or 7200 RPM) offer sufficient performance for are probably already heavily sequential.", "While Micron has announced general availability this week, distributors like CDW are not expecting stock for another week or two but are listing their prices for pre-orders.

{"title": "The Crucial P1 1TB SSD Review: The Other Consumer QLC SSD", "paragraph": ["The Crucial P1 SSD isn't quite the first at anything, but it is still a very novel product. It is the second consumer SSD on the market to use four bit per cell (QLC) NAND flash memory, after the ", ". It's the second QLC SSD from Micron, after their ", " enterprise SATA SSD that started shipping to select partners in May (and is now starting to be more widely available).", "More importantly however, it ", " the first consumer NVMe SSD that Micron has actually shipped. For all of their storied history in the SSD industry, Micron is pretty much the last SSD maker to enter the consumer NVMe market; and not for a lack of trying. The company's first attempt at an NVMe drive, the 2016 ", ", was ready to hit the market but was canceled when it became clear that it would not have been competitive. So this drive is a very important one for the company, despite the fact that its use of an NVMe/PCIe interface is hardly the most interesting aspect of the Crucial P1.", "Under the hood, the Crucial P1 starts from the same basic ingredients as the Intel 660p: Intel/Micron 64-layer 3D QLC NAND and the ", ". Micron has added their own firmware customization atop Silicon Motion's work, and the design of the Crucial P1 differs from the Intel 660p in several aspects — so this is not a case of two brands selling the exact same reference design SSD.", "Where the Intel 660p includes just 256MB of DRAM regardless of drive capacity, the Crucial P1 includes the same 1GB DRAM per 1TB NAND ratio that is used by most mainstream SSDs. This extra DRAM on the Crucial P1 should enable marginal improvements on benchmarks and workloads that touch large amounts of data, and probably allows a slight simplification to the drive's firmware. The Crucial P1 also has slightly lower usable capacities, eg. 500GB instead of 512GB, so there's a bit more spare area for the controller to work with. And whereas Intel's 2TB 660p is still a single-sided M.2 module, the upcoming 2TB Crucial P1 will have NAND and DRAM on both sides.", "The rest of the architecture of the Crucial P1 follows the same general strategies as the Intel 660p. The SM2263 controller is the smaller four-channel design from Silicon Motion's current generation, though it is a step above the DRAMless SM2263XT variant. The host interface is a PCIe 3.0 x4 link, but the Crucial P1 barely needs more than the PCIe 3.0 x2 link used by some competing entry-level NVMe controllers: peak sequential transfers for the P1 are only about 2GB/s.", "The use of QLC NAND means that the Crucial P1 is highly reliant on its SLC write cache to enable performance that can exceed what SATA SSDs provide. This is because the drive's QLC NAND isn't all that high performing on its own; it's dense, but it takes longer to program a block than MLC or TLC NAND. TLC for that matter is cache-sensitive for similar reasons, but QLC in turn has cranked up the importance of cache sizes and caching algorithms another notch, as the performance delta between the cache and the actual storage has increased.", "For Crucial's P1 the SLC cache is variable in size, and on a nearly-empty drive the cache will be substantially larger than what is usually found on TLC SSDs. Consumer drives that use TLC NAND often try to limit the maximum size of their SLC caches in order to reduce the amount of background work necessary in the event that the SLC write cache should overflow. The Crucial P1 is designed to do as much as possible to avoid falling off that performance cliff, rather than attempt to mitigate the effects when it does happen.", "When the SLC cache fills up, writes to the P1 get very slow. The P1 doesn't bypass the cache when it is full, so everything written to the drive is written to SLC first before being folded into QLC blocks. (This helps the P1 offer similar partial power loss protection to the Crucial MX series of SATA SSDs.) The P1 also tends to keep data in SLC so it can serve as a read cache instead of aggressively folding data into QLC blocks during idle time.", "All told, the caching strategy of the Crucial P1 maximizes performance and endurance for typical lightweight consumer/client storage workloads, but at the cost of performance on storage-intensive workloads. The P1 is definitely not the SSD to use in a workstation that regularly reads and writes datasets of many gigabytes, but it should be fine for more common desktop usage that is fairly read-heavy and only does multiple GB of writes on rare occasions such as when installing large software packages. This is in some sense just an amplification of the trends we saw as the SSD market moved from MLC to TLC NAND, but we do now have high-end TLC drives that can maintain high write speeds even after their SLC caches have filled. This is not true of the current two consumer QLC SSDs, and will probably always be a significant weakness of QLC SSDs.", "The other major tradeoff to the Crucial P1's use of QLC NAND is the lower write endurance compared to TLC SSDs. The P1 is rated for about 0.1 drive writes per day under a five-year warranty, while most consumer SSDs are rated for 0.3 up to about 1.0 DWPD for either three or five years. The P1 somewhat mitigates this by only offering large capacities of 500GB and up, so the total write endurance starts at a minimum of 100TB. This is adequate provided that most of the drive's capacity is used for static data. If the P1 has to hold hundreds of GB of data that changes as frequently as a web browser's cache and history, then 0.1 DWPD won't be enough. But in a more normal scenario where most of the data is media like movies and video games, then there's no problem.", "The early projections for QLC NAND write endurance were in the ballpark of a few hundred program/erase cycles at most, which would have required the QLC SSDs to be treated very carefully. The QLC NAND that Micron is now producing in volume can last for a similar number of P/E cycles as early TLC NAND, which is how the Crucial P1 can be usable for general-purpose consumer storage duties. Even after accounting for the write amplification caused by SLC caching and a realistic proportion of writes being random, the P1 is still rated for the equivalent of 200 full drive writes on the host side. (If those drive writes were entirely large-block sequential writes such as from re-imaging an entire drive, then the P1 should last much longer, but Micron doesn't want to complicate the endurance specs for their consumer drives that much.)", "In spite of the tradeoffs of lower performance and endurance, QLC drives like the Crucial P1 are worth a look because of their potential to also have significantly lower prices. At around 22¢/GB currently, the P1 isn't setting any records yet. Several industry reports have indicated that yields of Intel/Micron QLC are still poor, so the production costs of SSD-quality QLC aren't meaningfully lower than TLC yet. The other major NAND manufacturers are being less aggressive about bringing QLC to market, but once they have introduced their competitors we will probably see QLC products offering a more significant discount over TLC. NAND prices in general are also in decline, with some higher-volume TLC products leading the way ahead of even the QLC drives.", "The primary competition for the Crucial P1 is its close relative Intel 660p, as well as other entry-level NVMe SSDs. There is a low-end NVMe market segment with numerous options, but they are all struggling under the pressure from more competitively priced high-end NVMe SSDs. Products like the DRAMless Toshiba RC100 and HP EX900 haven't been able to get any traction when the HP EX920 is hitting the same prices. Thus, it is also fair to compare the Crucial P1 against such faster NVMe drives. The P1 is a modest step up in price over mainstream SATA SSDs, so this review includes benchmark results from the Crucial MX500."]},

{"title": "PCI-SIG Warns Of Incompatibilities Between M.2 And Samsung's NGSFF/NF1", "paragraph": ["PCI-SIG, the standards committee behind PCI Express and related standards, has issued a warning about incompatibilities between their M.2 standard and Samsung's NGSFF/NF1 SSD form factor. The notice from PCI-SIG does not refer to Samsung by name, but does indirectly call them out for basing a new form factor on a mechanically identical M.2 connector without introducing a new keying option to prevent improper insertion of M.2 drives into NGSFF slots or vice versa.", "Samsung's NGSFF form factor was unveiled in 2017 as a proposed replacement for M.2 and U.2 SSDs in datacenter applications. The goals are similar to the ", " derived from Intel's Ruler: provide more power than can be delivered over M.2's 3.3V supply, allow hot-swapping of cards, and widen the cards beyond the typical 22mm to allow for two rows of NAND flash packages side by side. Samsung's standard re-uses almost all of the data and ground pin assignments from M.2, but removes the 3.V supply and adds 12V power elsewhere.", "Samsung was initially hoping to call their standard M.3, but from what we've heard from unofficial sources this was going to make PCI-SIG very unhappy, so Samsung made a last-minute name change to NGSFF before going public. Not all of their partners got the message, and even Samsung's own exhibits did not quite have all traces of M.3 thoroughly erased. Since then, Samsung has pursued standardization through JEDEC with a new name of NF1 for the form factor, but that effort seems to have stalled earlier this year without achieving ratification. However, even without standardization, Samsung has been moving forward with deployment of NGSFF SSDs and they have ", " along the way, including OEMs like Supermicro and AIC.", "PCI-SIG's complaints about NGSFF are all about conflicting pin assignments for the M.2 M-keyed connector. In order to add 12V power and PCIe dual-port capability, Samsung had to make use of many previously-unassigned pins that existing M.2 drives and sockets leave disconnected. Several of Samsung's new pin assignments conflict with new assignments for the forthcoming M.2 revision 1.2 specification, which will add an optional set of USB 2.0 data lines and the option of a 1.8V power supply and lower-voltage signaling on some control lines. The warning from PCI-SIG neglects to mention that some of these conflicts are still largely hypothetical and is written as if the 1.2 revision of the M.2 spec were already finalized, though it is expected to be complete by the end of this year.", "Some of the pin assignment conflicts pose a risk even with currently extant products. For example, NGSFF SSDs have a ground connection on pin 20, adjacent to pin 18 where M.2 sockets provide 3.3V power, so an NGSFF SSD inserted into a standard M.2 socket is just one bent pin away from a short circuit. (There's a more serious conflict in the other direction with the upcoming M.2 standard, which adds a ground connection on one of the same pins that Samsung is using for 12V.) There are also five pins that NGSFF uses which are still unassigned even in revision 1.2 of the M.2 spec, and thus leave the door open for more future conflicts.", "The incompatibilities between M.2 and NGSFF may develop into a serious problem, but as things currently stand the warnings from PCI-SIG are a bit overblown. Some degree of electrical compatibility between NGSFF and the current M.2 revision 1.1 is possible, proving that there is some utility to Samsung's re-use of the same mechanical connector with a similar pin-out. Minerva, Taiwanese makers of ", ", has several adapters that provide slots capable of accepting M.2 and M.3 NGSFF SSDs. These adapters are safe to use with M.2 SSDs that adhere to the current spec and do not connect the unassigned pins that Samsung uses to deliver 12V power, but could cause problems with upcoming M.2 revision 1.2 cards (and are subject to the adjacent 3.3V and ground pin risk mentioned above).", "More importantly, real-world mistakes between M.2 and NGSFF are unlikely given the typical use-case for NGSFF SSDs: as hot-swappable drives mounted to trays that do not accept M.2 SSDs. Putting a NGSFF SSD into a M.2 socket will usually require removing the drive from the tray. Putting a M.2 SSD into a NGSFF socket without a tray to guide it would be difficult. Most of the opportunities for a dangerous mismatch come when using adapters from other connectors (eg. PCIe x4 slot) to M.2 or NGSFF, and current adapters avoid most of the risk of damage. The existence of Samsung's NGSFF form factor may serve as a deterrent to adoption of M.2 revision 1.2 features, though it seems that those new features are unlikely to have much market overlap with the strictly datacenter-oriented NGSFF. And if the EDSFF standards win out over NGSFF, then Samsung's form factor may end up being rather short-lived before falling into obscurity."]},

The Mushkin Source is a current-generation example that provides only modest improvements over older DRAMless SSDs, but is adequate for most home systems.", "The Mushkin Source is an entry-level SSD designed to offer the absolute lowest cost possible from current-generation components. The 500GB drive we're testing today is currently for sale at $65, putting the price per GB at a very low $0.13.", "Specifications for our drive look pretty standard for a drive in this price range: peak sequential read speeds of 560 MB/s, writes at 520 MB/s, and 75k/81k IOPs respectively. Mushkin rates the drive at 2 W active and 80 mW idle, and with a three-year warranty that is typical for entry-level SSDs. The write endurance ratings are pretty low - for this 500GB drive that is 200TB total writes, which equates to a paltry 0.22 drive writes per day over those three years, equivalent to about 0.13 DWPD over five years (our usual metric).", "That endurance value is almost as low as what we're seeing from SSDs that use QLC NAND, and is likely due to a combination of the DRAMless controller making it harder to keep write amplification low, and Mushkin potentially using somewhat lower-grade flash in the Source. Nevertheless, the aim of this drive is primarily cost, and is aimed at a home user unlikely to do 100GB of writes per day every day.", "SATA SSDs with four-bit-per-cell QLC NAND flash memory are coming, but are not yet available in the consumer market and yield issues are preventing QLC from yet offering a meaningful discount relative to TLC NAND. That has led Mushkin to use a more familiar formula for the Source: 3D TLC NAND combined with a DRAMless SSD controller. Drives in this market segment always make sacrifices to reach the lowest price points, but they don't all make the same tradeoffs.", "NAND flash memory prices have been in steep decline in recent months, and Mushkin has for the most part been able to keep pace with price drops for the Source. There have been occasions where more mainstream SATA drives with DRAM caches have gone on sale for lower prices than DRAMless drives, but the Mushkin Source has usually been quite close to being the cheapest SSD on the market from a reputable brand. Almost any SSD can garner some measure of success simply by being the cheapest. Being the cheapest *and* offering better than bottom-of-the-barrel specifications is harder to pull off.", "The Mushkin Source uses Silicon Motion's SM2258XT controller, the DRAMless variant of the familiar SM2258. There is a newer SM2259 SATA controller but it doesn't offer any significant benefits for consumer SSDs, so the 2258XT can still be regarded as the current-generation solution from Silicon Motion. The Source uses Micron 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, which has proven to be much faster than their previous 32-layer 3D NAND and has been used in great products in all segments of the SSD market.", "With only four NAND channels coming off the small SM2258XT controller and no external DRAM packages, the PCB inside the Mushkin Source is quite compact. Unusually, the SATA connector is not a discrete component attached to the edge of the circuit board but instead is formed from a combination of exposed contacts on the PCB itself and a plastic part to fill out the rest of the connector's shape. This may not be as durable as a discrete connector and certainly doesn't look as neat, but it works fine and probably saves a few cents. There's a token thermal pad between two of the NAND flash packages and the case, but is seems unlikely to have much effect on the drive's operation.", "Mainstream SATA SSD product lines seldom offer a 120/128GB option these days due to the lower performance such small drives suffer from with only four NAND flash chips to work with. For entry-level products like the Mushkin Source, 120GB options are still relatively common even though they carry a significantly higher price per GB than 240GB and larger drives. As can be expected, the specifications for the smallest Mushkin Source reflect this lower performance, and the 250GB model improves on it but is still not up to full speed for things like random read throughput.", "The primary competition for the Mushkin Source is other dirt-cheap SATA SSDs. Most of these are also DRAMless SSDs, usually based on Silicon Motion or Phison reference designs and sold by numerous brands. We have the Toshiba TR200 standing in for the Phison-based drives - availability of the TR200 has been inconsistent and pricing has often been far too high, but its performance is representative of cheaper products that use the same Phison S11 DRAMless controller with Toshiba 64L 3D TLC. The other DRAMless SSD in this review is the HP S700, which uses the same SM2258XT controller but older 32-layer Micron 3D TLC NAND.", "It's also fair to compare the Source against mainstream SATA SSDs with DRAM caches, because the best deals in that market segment are usually within a few dollars of the going rate for DRAMless SSDs, and the more popular and thus higher-volume mainstream products occasionally end up undercutting DRAMless drives on price."]},

This week's releases are the 1.5TB 905P add-in card and 960GB and 1.5TB 905P U.2 drives, bringing the consumer lineup and the ", " line both up to the same maximum capacity.", "The larger capacity options don't bring any more performance improvements because they are still using the same controller, and even the smallest 280GB 900P had enough 3D XPoint dies to keep every channel of the controller busy. The bigger drives do have higher power consumption, with the 1.5TB 905P add-in card rated for up to 17.7 W for write operations.", "We have probably reached the end of the line for capacity increases while Intel is still using first-generation 3D XPoint memory for their consumer Optane products, because Intel is still charging well over $1/GB and that means even the 1.5TB 905P will cost more than a well-equipped gaming PC. However, interesting things are happening at the lower capacities.", "The ", " is getting closer to release, and the specifications are now shown on the 905P product page (though not yet on ark.intel.com). The 1.5TB U.2 drives are the first products to use BGA packages of eight 3D XPoint dies, for a capacity of 128GB per package. Those same packages could potentially be used to deliver a 750GB M.2 version of the 905P. However, power consumption is getting to be a problem with the 380GB M.2 rated for 11.7W during write operations. M.2 connectors are typically rated to carry only 4.5A across all the 3.3V supply pins, for a limit of 14.85 W. A 750GB M.2 would likely need some throttling or other power saving measures in order to reliably operate within that limit, and even the 380GB drive will likely stress the current delivery capacity of some M.2 slots.", "On the enterprise side of things, the ", " has still not officially launched, but ", ". The capacity is similar to the Optane SSD 800P's 118GB limit, but the P4801X is still using the full seven-channel controller with a PCIe x4 host interface so performance is far higher. The 100GB P4801X isn't as fast as the larger P4800X and 900P/905P drives—write speeds in particular have suffered with a mere 1GB/s sequential write and 250k random write IOPS. But the latency ratings for this small Optane drive are still just as fast, and the active power rating of 7W is quite reasonable for a M.2 drive.", " ", "Intel's announcement this week has been accompanied by fresh roadmap leaks from a slide deck intended for an event in November. The file was found on Intel's Russian website and appears to be authentic, but the information in it is still subject to change. The leaked roadmap shows the original Optane Memory M.2 and the Optane SSD 800P being discontinued in early 2019, though the Optane M10 M.2 cache module will remain through at least the middle of next year. A discontinuation of the 800P would clear the way for a consumer counterpart to the smaller P4801X, in M.2 form factor. Intel might not want to put such a product in their 905P product line, but capacities in the 100-200GB range would be a very welcome performance boost over the 800P while still remaining somewhat affordable. However, this still wouldn't give Intel a high-performance Optane M.2 SSD for the mainstream consumer market because the current 905P and P4801X M.2 hardware is a 110mm-long double-sided M.2 card that can't physically fit in laptops and would also be incompatible with some desktops."]},
{"title": "The Kingston HyperX Fury RGB SSD Review: Bright Idea, Dimmed Performance", "paragraph": ["No component in a gaming desktop PC is safe from the RGB LED lighting trend. SSDs with LED lighting have existed as a tiny niche for years, but now that motherboards are integrating lighting controllers, that product segment is expanding significantly. Kingston's HyperX gaming brand is introducing the Fury RGB SSD to capitalize on the seemingly unstoppable (and oddly lucrative) trend.", "The original HyperX Fury SSD was released back in 2014 and used a SandForce controller combined with 20nm planar MLC NAND. This new HyperX Fury RGB SSD has almost nothing in common with that older drive on the inside, though the non-LED parts of the visual styling are quite similar. The Fury RGB uses current-generation Toshiba/SanDisk 64-layer 3D TLC NAND and Marvell's 88SS1074 controller.", "The lighting on the Fury RGB is controllable through a connector next to the SATA power and data connectors. Kingston used a USB micro-B connector here, but it's not electrically compatible with USB. Instead, the adapter cable included with the drive must be used to connect to a 4-pin 12V RGB header on the motherboard or other lighting controller. This allows the color of the lighting to be adjusted as a group; individual control of the LEDs is not possible. Alternatively, if the LED cable is not connected, the drive will default to illuminating the red LEDs using the 12V supply on the SATA power connector while the rest of the device uses the 5V supply like a normal SATA SSD. The LEDs can also be powered and controlled solely through the LED cable even when the SATA power connector is not supplying any power.", "The HyperX Fury uses a staggering 75 RGB LED modules internally, mounted on the same PCB as the storage-related components. The LEDs are distributed to provide thorough coverage of the backlit HyperX logo and the edge highlights. The light shines through a thin sheet of white plastic that acts as a diffuser, and the through a perforated sheet of metal that adds some texture to the lighting effect. Those two layers also block a lot of light, which is probably why the Fury RGB needs so many LEDs. The lighting forces the HyperX Fury RGB to be slightly thicker than most SATA SSDs at 9.5mm instead of 7mm.", "", "On the storage side of the PCB, we find typical mainstream SATA SSD components. Kingston only provides sequential I/O performance specifications which indicate SATA-saturating peak performance, but they are not saying anything about how performance scales with capacity, nor how things behave when the SLC write cache fills up. The power draw ratings seem to be based on the drive operating with the LEDs off and peak write power of 2.5 W is reasonable for a drive using modern, low-power 3D NAND. The HyperX Fury RGB is warranted for a write endurance of 0.46 DWPD over three years, equivalent to a bit less than 0.3 DWPD if it had the 5-year warranty duration that mainstream SATA drives usually come with.", "The MSRPs for the Fury RGB reflect a fairly steep price premium for the RGB lighting. The Fury RGB will hit the market with pricing more typical of an entry or mid-level NVMe SSD than a SATA SSD with only a 3-year warranty. Kingston's own A1000 low-end NVMe SSD is currently selling for well below the MSRPs of the HyperX Fury RGB, so the Fury RGB is clearly only for enthusiasts who are willing to sacrifice performance and pay a premium to get the aesthetics they want from their SSD.", "It's been a while since we received a SATA drive using the Marvell 88SS1074 controller; most of the SATA drives we've been seeing lately have used either Silicon Motion or Phison controllers. The turnkey solutions offered by those two vendors seem to be a lot more popular with the smaller SSD brands than Marvell's offerings. Some of the biggest brands have also been lured away from Marvell, most notably the Crucial M/MX series that switched to Silicon Motion's SM2258 after using Marvell controllers for all their previous high-end 6Gbps SATA SSDs. Western Digital still uses the 88SS1074 controller in their WD Blue SSDs, but they switched from Marvell to an in-house controller for the 3D NAND update to their WD Black SSD.", "The Toshiba/SanDisk BiCS3 64-layer 3D TLC NAND flash used in the HyperX Fury RGB is a much more common sight on our SSD testbed this year, both in NVMe and SATA SSDs. Virtually all drives using Phison controllers are using Toshiba NAND, and this includes Toshiba's own TR200 SATA SSD with the DRAMless Phison S11 controller. The Plextor M8V is a more mainstream drive, pairing  the same NAND with the SM2258 controller. The M8V has been scarce at retailers but its OEM counterpart (Liteon CV8) has been used by major OEMs like Dell.", "It's hard to decide which drives are the best to compare the Fury RGB against, since most of our SSDs don't have LED lighting. Ignoring the lighting aspect, the drives that are most technologically similar are the Toshiba TR200 and Plextor M8V, SATA drives with the same NAND and different controllers. The Crucial MX500 and Intel 545s are mainstream SATA drives with Intel/Micron 64-layer TLC.", "The price premium that the LED lighting brings to the Fury RGB brings it up to the level of some of the cheaper NVMe SSDs. Kingston's own A1000 is an entry-level NVMe SSD using the Phison E8 controlller, and it is substantially cheaper than the Fury RGB's MSRPs. Meanwhile the ADATA XPG SX8200 uses the much higher-performing combination of Micron 64L 3D TLC and the SM2262 controller and costs about the same as the Fury RGB.", "For this review, two sets of power measurements are reported for the Fury RGB: the total power draw across both 5V and 12V rails with the LEDs illuminated in their default red color, and the power on just the 5V rail. These two sets of measurements come from the same test runs, so there's only one set of performance numbers. At full brightness, the red LEDs draw about 2.24 W when powered by the SATA power connecter, and this is enough to keep the drive rather warm even when it is idle. With all three color channels illuminated, LED power consumption exceeds 4W but we did not leave it connected to the multimeter long enough for the drive to reach an equilibrium temperature and power draw. (I didn't want to burn out the breadboard I was using to wire things up.)", "Our SSD coverage in recent months has been heavily focused on NVMe SSDs as the more active and exciting market segment. As a result, our post-Spectre/Meltdown re-testing of drives has included relatively few SATA SSDs. Most of our small and low-end SATA drives have not yet completed the longer AnandTech Storage Bench tests, so this review has fewer results for The Destroyer and the ATSB Heavy test than we typically include."]},
{"title": "The Team Group Delta RGB SSD Review: Lite Performance, Light Drive", "paragraph": ["Complementing ", ", we have another SATA SSD with customizable RGB LED lighting: Team Group's T-Force Delta RGB. Like the Kingston HyperX Fury RGB, this is a mainstream SATA drive augmented with RGB LEDs, which can be powered and controlled through a compatible motherboard header to illuminate the top of the drive case. However, the similarities between the two drives end there.", "The T-Force Delta RGB SSD takes a very different approach from the HyperX Fury RGB for implementing the lighting. Where the Fury RGB put its LEDs on the back side of the SSD PCB, the Delta RGB uses a separate circuit board entirely. The top side of the drive is dominated by a textured clear plastic diffuser that is edge-lit by a single row of RGB LEDs. The T-Force Gaming logo is printed in black on this plastic piece and is silhouetted by the LED lighting, rather than being a directly illuminated logo as with the HyperX Fury RGB. Since the Delta RGB is only lit from one side there is some non-uniformity in brightness across the surface of the drive, but none of the localized variations in brightness that result from the Fury RGB's more direct backlighting. Overall the Delta RGB emits much more light than the Fury RGB despite using 8 RGB LED modules to the Fury's 75 modules.", "The Delta RGB uses a digital signaling protocol for its LEDs, allowing each of the eight RGB LED modules to be controlled individually, so the drive is not limited to solid color illumination. Even though the Team Delta RGB and the HyperX Fury RGB both reuse micro-USB type B connectors for their lighting, their adapter cables are completely incompatible and require different motherboard headers. The Delta RGB's LEDs run off 5V power while the much larger array of LEDs on the Fury RGB unsurprisingly required a 12V supply.", "Where the power consumption and heat generated by the LEDs on the Fury RGB seemed to be the cause of some performance problems and definitely made the drive warm to the touch, the Delta RGB's lighting solution doesn't seem to have any impact on the drive's storage functions. When a single color set of LEDs is illuminated on the Delta RGB the LEDs use a little over 0.5 W and setting the red, green and blue components all to full brightness only requires about 1.4W. By comparison, the HyperX Fury RGB requires about 2.3W for its LEDs when set to red and over 4W when everything is lit.", "Team offers a few cosmetic variants of the Delta RGB. The metal case can be had with a white finish instead of the matte black our sample uses. The Delta RGB reviewed here uses a 3-pin 5V digital interface for powering and controlling the LEDs, allowing the color of each of the 8 LEDs to be set individually. Team has also announced two versions with different lighting schemes: the Delta S using a 4-pin 12V header to set a single solid color for all the LEDs, and a Delta R with an animated rainbow color effect powered (but not controlled) off a USB 2.0 header. The Delta S doesn't seem to be currently available through the usual online retailers, but the more recently announced Delta R is in stock at Newegg.", "Aside from the RGB lighting, the Delta RGB is a fairly boring SSD. It uses the very familiar Silicon Motion SM2258 controller and Micron's last-generation 32-layer 3D TLC NAND, a combination we've dealt with several times before.", "Micron's first-generation 3D TLC NAND was produced in the unusual 384Gb (48GB) per die capacity. This means the Delta RGB has quite a bit more spare area to work with than a typical drive: the 250GB model has 288GB of flash. For some reason, our sample branded as a 250GB drive actually has the same usable capacity as a typical 256GB SSD. The larger models probably also offer slightly more usable capacity than they advertise, since there's plenty of raw NAND to go around even after setting aside a generous SLC write cache. However, the odd die capacity has a downside in that the flash is not optimally arranged. The 250GB Delta RGB only uses three of the four channels provided by the SM2258 controller. With a fast enough NAND interface this doesn't have to be a serious problem, but Micron's 32L 3D NAND wasn't particularly fast and we can't expect the Delta RGB to be setting any performance records.", "The transition to 3D NAND brought a jump in per-die capacities, and Micron's first generation of 3D NAND went a little too far with the 384Gb TLC parts. The consequences for consumer SSDs that almost exclusively used TLC were that low-capacity drives had very few dies to access in parallel. The performance hit that causes led to most product lines abandoning the 120GB capacity class, and many SSD vendors stopped providing review samples smaller than 480GB. Since our Delta RGB sample is a 256GB drive, we only have one SATA SSD of comparable capacity using current-generation 64-layer 3D TLC to compare against, and that's the entry-level Toshiba TR200 DRAMless SSD. This review also includes several 480-512GB drives with 64L 3D NAND to compare against, but their higher capacity gives them a natural advantage for performance. The drives that are the closest to the Delta RGB in terms of performance expectations are the 256GB ADATA Ultimate SU800 and HP S700 Pro, both of which use the same SM2258 controller and Micron 32L TLC.", "Since the RGB LED lighting drives the price of the Delta RGB far beyond other mainstream or low-end SATA SSDs, this review also compares the Delta RGB to some NVMe SSDs with similar pricing. The MyDigitalSSD SBX is an entry-level NVMe SSD using Toshiba 64L TLC and the Phison E8 controller. The ADATA XPG SX8200 uses the more high-end combination of Micron 64L TLC and the Silicon Motion SM2262 controller, but in the 240GB capacity is isn't quite as fast as the larger capacities that compete well against the flagship NVMe drives from Samsung and Western Digital.", "The Delta RGB was put through our SSD benchmark suite with its lighting disabled, since our testbed's motherboard doesn't have RGB headers. The HyperX Fury RGB was tested with its red LEDs on at full brightness because that's its default behavior when the LED control cable is not plugged in, but the Delta RGB's LEDs are on an entirely separate circuit board from the SSD and cannot draw any power except through the LED cable. For the HyperX Fury RGB we report two sets of power measurements to reflect the total power draw including LEDs and the storage-only power draw from just the 5V supply. For the Delta RGB, we only report the power draw with the LEDs disconnected and off."]},

The Extreme Portable SSD carries a WD Blue 3D NAND SSD (BiCS 64-layer 3D TLC flash) with the Marvell 88SS1074 SSD controller.", "We can clearly see the ASMedia ASM235CM acting as a SATA - USB 3.1 Gen 2 bridge chip.

All three capacities are single-sided M.2 2280 cards with a constant 256MB of DRAM. Mainstream SSDs typically use 1 GB of DRAM per 1TB of flash, so the 660p is rather short on DRAM even at the 512GB capacity.

The small size of the SM2263 controller allows Intel to fit all four NAND packages used by the 2TB model on one side of the PCB.", "Intel doesn't break down performance specs for the 660p by drive capacity, and the read and write performance ratings are the same, thanks to the acceleration of SLC write caching. Intel doesn't provide any official spec for write performance after the SLC cache is filled, but we've measured about 100 MB/s on our 1TB sample. This steady-state sequential write speed will vary with drive capacity. Intel is offering a 5 year warranty on the drive and write endurance is about 0.1 drive writes per day, lower than the 0.3 DWPD typical of mainstream consumer SSDs, but something that should still adequate for most users.", "Probably the most important aspect of a consumer QLC drive design is the behavior of the SLC cache. Consumer TLC drives universally treat a portion of their NAND flash memory as pseudo-SLC, using that higher-performing memory segment as a write cache. QLC SSDs are even more reliant on SLC caching because the performance of raw QLC NAND is even lower than that of TLC.", "No SLC caching strategy can perfectly accelerate every workload and use case, and there are significant tradeoffs between different strategies. The Intel SSD 660p employs a variable-size SLC cache, and all data written goes first to the SLC cache before being compacted and folded into QLC blocks. This means that the steady-state 100MB/s sequential write speed we've measured is significantly below what the drive could deliver if the writes went directly to the QLC without the extra SLC to QLC copying step getting in the way. When the drive is mostly empty, up to about half of the available flash memory cells will be treated as SLC NAND. As the drive fills up, blocks will be converted to QLC usage, shrinking the size of the cache and making it more likely that a real-world use case could write enough to fill that cache.", "Our current test suite cannot fully capture the dynamics of a variable-size SLC cache, and we haven't had the 660p in hand long enough to thoroughly test it at various states of fill. When the Intel SSD 660p is mostly empty and the SLC cache size is huge, many of our standard benchmarks end up testing primarily the performance of the SLC cache — and for reads in addition to writes, because in these conditions the 660p isn't very aggressive about moving data from SLC blocks to QLC. As a result, our synthetic benchmark tests have been run both with our standard methodology, and with a completely full drive so that the tests measure performance of the QLC memory (with an SLC cache that is too small to entirely contain any of our tests). The two sets of scores thus represent the two extremes of performance that the Intel SSD 660p can deliver. The full-drive results in this review represent a worst-case scenario that will almost never be encountered by real-world usage, because our tests give the drive limited idle time to flush the SLC cache but in the real world consumer workloads almost always give SSDs far more idle time than they need.", "Intel's initial pricing for the 660p works out to just under 20¢/GB, putting it very close to the street prices of the cheapest current-generation TLC-based SSDs. The Intel SSD 660p goes on sale today, and is being showcased by Intel at Flash Memory Summit this week. In traveling to FMS, I left behind a testbed full of drives running extra benchmarks for this review. When I can catch a break from all the news and activities at FMS, I will be adding to this review.", "The Intel SSD 660p is positioned as a very cheap entry-level NVMe SSD, so our primary focus is on comparing it against other low-end NVMe drives and against SATA drives. As usual, the Crucial MX500 serves as our representative of mainstream SATA SSDs thanks to its consistently good pricing and solid all-around performance. The other low-end NVMe SSDs in this review are the 660p's predecessor Intel SSD 600p, the Phison E8-based Kingston A1000 and and the Toshiba RC100 DRAMless NVMe SSD that uses the Host Memory Buffer feature."]},

The TEKQ Rapide enclosure includes thermal pads for both the M.2 SSD and the Thunderbolt 3 controller.", "As a refresher, the SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD is essentially the same as the Western Digital WD Black 3D NAND SSD (", ") except for the external branding. It uses Western Digital's in-house controller and couples it with 64-layer BiCS 3D TLC flash. While the SSD itself claims transfer rates of 3400 MBps reads and 2800 MBps writes, the extent of throttling introduced by the enclosure is not immediately evident.", "Various synthetic benchmarks are available to quickly evaluate the performance of direct-attached storage devices. Real-world performance testing often has to be a customized test. We present both varieties in this review, starting with the synthetic benchmarks in this section. Prior to covering those, we have a quick look at our testbed setup and testing methodology.", "Evaluation of DAS units on Windows is done with the testbed outlined in the table below. For devices with a Thunderbolt 3 (Type-C interface) connections (such as the DIY TEKQ Rapide - SanDisk Extreme Pro TB3 SSD 1TB that we are considering today), we utilize the USB 3.1 Type-C port enabled by the Intel Alpine Ridge controller. It connects to the Z170 PCH via a PCIe 3.0 x4 link.", "The full details of the reasoning behind choosing the above build components can be found ", ". The list of DAS units used for comparison purposes is provided below.", "The SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD's 3.4 GBps / 2.8 GBps numbers for read and write accesses seem to get throttled down to around 2.7 GBps / 2.4 GBps due to the external enclosure, as per the ATTO benchmarks provided below. Unfortunately, these access traces are not very common in real-life scenarios.", "CrystalDiskMark, despite being a canned benchmark, provides a better estimate of the performance range with a selected set of numbers.", "As evident from the screenshot below, the performance can dip to as low as 40 MBps for random reads at low queue depths. However, peak performance is as good, if not better, than the numbers from ATTO.", "Our testing methodology for DAS units also takes into consideration the usual use-case for such devices. The most common usage scenario is transfer of large amounts of photos and videos to and from the unit. The minor usage scenario is importing files directly off the DAS into a multimedia editing program such as Adobe Photoshop.", "In order to tackle the first use-case, we created three test folders with the following characteristics:", "For the second use-case, we take advantage of PC Mark 8's storage bench. The storage workload involves games as well as multimedia editing applications. The command line version allows us to cherry-pick storage traces to run on a target drive. We chose the following traces.", "Usually, PC Mark 8 reports time to complete the trace, but the detailed log report has the read and write bandwidth figures which we present in our performance graphs. Note that the bandwidth number reported in the results don't involve idle time compression. Results might appear low, but that is part of the workload characteristic. Note that the same testbed is being used for all DAS units. Therefore, comparing the numbers for each trace should be possible across different DAS units.", "We can see that the SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD, when placed inside a TEKQ Rapide enclosure, and formatted in NTFS, is at the top of the charts in almost all the workloads.", "Yet another interesting aspect of these types of units is performance consistency. Aspects that may influence this include thermal throttling and firmware caps on access rates to avoid overheating or other similar scenarios. This aspect is an important one, as the last thing that users want to see when copying over, say, 100 GB of data to the flash drive, is the transfer rate going to USB 2.0 speeds. In order to identify whether the drive under test suffers from this problem, we instrumented our robocopy DAS benchmark suite to record the flash drive's read and write transfer rates while the robocopy process took place in the background. For supported drives, we also recorded the internal temperature of the drive during the process. The graphs below show the speeds observed during our real-world DAS suite processing. The first three sets of writes and reads correspond to the photos suite. A small gap (for the transfer of the videos suite from the primary drive to the RAM drive) is followed by three sets for the next data set. Another small RAM-drive transfer gap is followed by three sets for the Blu-ray folder.", "An important point to note here is that each of the first three blue and green areas correspond to 15.6 GB of writes and reads respectively. Throttling, if any, is apparent within the processing of the photos suite itself. Here, we can see the first set of photo writes reach higher peak write speeds compared to the other two sets. This has to do with the amount of SLC cache available for filling up during the transfer. However, temperatures are normal (less than 60C) throughout the test, pointing to the thermal solution being very effective.", "Western Digital / SanDisk also shipped the SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD without any heatspreader. The uncommon layout that places the controller in the middle of the stick with NAND flash memory on both sides of the controller is adequate to prevent overheating, and the thermal pads on the TEKQ Rapide chassis are more than enough to prevent the SSD from going above 60C in the course of our heavy DAS workload.", "The Thunderbolt 3 specifications indicate that the host port must be able to supply up to 15W for bus-powered devices connected to it. Since the TEKQ Rapide is a bus-powered device, it is given that its power consumption can't exceed 15W in order to be a certified Thunderbolt 3 device. It is still relevant to take a fine-grained look at the power consumption profile, since the SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD we are putting in has a very different performance and power profile compared to the Phison E7 reference design that it originally shipped with. Using the ", ", the bus power consumption for the unit was tracked while the CrystalDiskMark workloads were processed. The workloads were set up with an interval time of 30s.", "We find that the peak power consumption is slightly south of 8W (compared to the sub-7W profile of the 240GB Phison E7 reference SSD in the TEKQ Rapide). The SSD idles at around 2.8W (compared to 2.5W of the original configuration).", "Support for TRIM is an important aspect - it ensures that performance consistency is maintained even after the SSD has been subject to long-term use. Since the Thunderbolt interface is transparent for all practical purposes, and the host OS sees a PCIe NVMe SSD, it comes down to the SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD supporting TRIM. We were able to successfully activate TRIM with the configuration.", "The final aspect that we deal with in the review is the pricing. Since we have a DIY configuration, the 'build' involves buying the TEKQ Rapide enclosure with the minimal capacity SSD, and re-using the internal SSD for some other purpose. The cost breakdown is presented in the table below.", "Flash prices are on a downward trend, and it is likely that the configuration will become cheaper in the coming months. Even without discounting the extra NVMe SSD's cost, the price per GB comes to a respectable $0.64/GB, which is cheaper than the approx. $0.80/GB for the 1TB TEKQ Rapide SSD. That said, the cost is not as economical as what has been promised for the upcoming Phison reference designs for portable Thunderbolt 3 SSDs (in the range of $0.45 to $0.50/GB for the 1TB variants). However, they are not expected to provide as much performance as our DIY configuration.", "At the business end of the review, we can say without hesitation that the DIY Thunderbolt 3 SSD presents a very valuable proposition to the end user. In particular, the TEKQ Rapide can leave the consumer with a spare 240GB NVMe SSD that can be used in the recent NUCs or a number of other modern PC platforms. The WD Black / SanDisk Extreme Pro SSDs have great performance for DAS workloads, and team up effectively with the TEKQ Rapide enclosure for a high-performance portable Thunderbolt 3 SSD that doesn't break the bank."]},

Phison's controllers range from tiny low-power chips for USB flash drives and memory cards up to high-end NVMe SSD controllers, ending up in drives such as the ", ", and the ", ". The Phison E12 is its latest flagship NVMe controller intended for high-end consumer SSDs and enterprise SSDs. We have an engineering sample of Phison's reference design for a consumer M.2 NVMe SSD with the E12 controller and 1TB of Toshiba 3D TLC NAND flash memory. Phison — and the many brands that base their SSDs on Phison designs — are hoping that this new combination will be able to compete against top SSDs from the vertically-integrated giants like Samsung and Western Digital.", "Phison has a close relationship with Toshiba, and most Phison-based consumer SSDs from the past several years have used Toshiba NAND flash. This was a bit of a hindrance for brands using Phison controllers during the year where Samsung and IMFT were shipping 3D NAND but Toshiba was still primarily producing 15nm planar NAND. Phison's first NVMe controller (E7) was used almost exclusively with Toshiba's 15nm MLC NAND and consequently those drives tended to have more limited capacities and higher per-GB prices than their competition.", "The situation this year is quite different. Toshiba's 64L 3D TLC is very competitive, and when paired with the right controller it can deliver great performance (as seen in the ", ") and great power efficiency (as seen in the ", ").", "Late last year, Phison's E8 controller arrived in the retail market with the ", ". This second-generation NVMe controller is aimed at the low-end NVMe SSD market: it features fewer PCIe lanes and NAND channels than a typical high-end SSD and is fabbed on a cheaper 40nm process rather than the 28nm process used by most cutting-edge SSD controllers. The Phison E12 is the high-end member of this second generation, and it brings all the features we expect from a controller for this market segment: support for features from the latest NVMe 1.3 standard, LDPC error correction robust enough to support 3D TLC and QLC NAND, enough channels and chip enable pins to support up to 8TB of flash, and support for DDR4 DRAM. Manufacturing on TSMC's 28nm process provides the transistor budget to enable all of those features while keeping power consumption reasonable.", "", "Earlier Phison NVMe controllers have relied on BCH error correction and Phison's proprietary StrongECC error correction, but the Phison E12 finally brings full LDPC support. This comes at a relatively high transistor cost compared to simpler ECC schemes, but is allows for high throughput and low power encoding and decoding. The ECC engine can easily be one of the most performance-critical parts of a NVMe SSD controller, and the Phison E12's error correction should be much faster than any of their previous controllers. It should also provide a longer usable write endurance, which is why Phison also markets the E12 as their first controller suitable for use with QLC NAND.", "Phison's performance estimates for their controllers are based on the contemporary NAND that they are expected to be paired with. In the case of the E12, this is Toshiba's current 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, though we may also see drives using their 96L NAND during the E12's lifetime. Using 3D TLC, the E12 promises to deliver much higher performance than the previous-generation E7 could even when using MLC NAND.", "Our Phison E12 engineering sample features 1TB of Toshiba 64L 3D TLC NAND flash memory and 1GB of DDR4 DRAM, on a double-sided M.2 2280 card. The usable capacity is configured as 960 GB, so this drive has plenty of spare area to work with (by consumer SSD standards). Many brands that use the Phison E12 will also offer 2TB models, but performance shouldn't be much higher than this 1TB sample.", "For this review, we are comparing the E12 sample against a variety of SSDs that have already hit the market. Retail drives based on the E12 should arrive very soon, probably starting with the MyDigitalSSD BPX Pro, successor to the BPX that was the most affordable E7-based SSD. MyDigitalSSD hasn't shared specific timing or pricing, but the BPX Pro should be on sale by the end of this summer. We expect pricing will be below the current top TLC-based SSDs, so the results from MLC-based drives and the Intel Optane SSD 900P represent a much higher price bracket than Phison E12 drives will occupy.", "We are also expecting a wave of new SSD announcements over the next month leading in to Flash Memory Summit, August 7-9. We hope to hear plans for products using Silicon Motion's SM2262EN, an upgraded version of their SM2262 controller that is currently shipping in drives like the ", " and ADATA SX8200. We will have a review of a SM2262EN engineering sample ready soon to see which new controller is likely to come out on top this fall. Unless Samsung, Western Digital or Toshiba brings out a more affordable high-end drive that delivers at least as much performance as their current flagships, the best value NVMe SSD going into the holiday season will probably be based on either the Phison E12 or the SM2262EN."]},

Toshiba's BG1 only offered 128GB and 256GB capacities, and the BG2 and BG3 only go up to 512GB. Toshiba's BG series and the RC100 also don't have a DRAM die in the stack, so these are DRAMless SSDs, and as we'll see can definitely behave like one.

HMB is an optional feature that was added in version 1.2 of the NVMe specification, released in 2014. Though the feature was standardized years ago, adoption has been slow because there hasn't been much of a market for low-end NVMe SSDs in either the retail or OEM channels, and Microsoft's NVMe driver didn't implement HMB support until the Windows 10 Anniversary Update in 2016.", "The Toshiba RC100 is available in capacities from 120GB to 480GB, essentially the same as the BG3 but with more spare area reserved to allow for slightly higher performance than the BG3.

The way MyDigitalSSD distinguishes themselves from the many competing brands is by offering drives for substantially lower prices and by being one of the first to market with new controllers from Phison. The SBX checks both boxes: it is priced below the Samsung 860 EVO SATA SSD, and it hit the market in December 2017 as the first Phison E8 drive to ship and one of the earliest retail SSDs to feature Toshiba/SanDisk 64-layer 3D NAND.", "As one of the cheapest NVMe SSDs on the retail market, the MyDigitalSSD SBX is a good indicator of the progress NVMe drives have made toward replacing SATA SSDs instead of merely coexisting as a premium high-end alternative.", "The Phison E8 controller is one of Phison's low-end options from their second generation of NVMe SSD controllers. The E8 features just two PCIe lanes instead of the usual 4 enabled by an M.2 slot, and a four-channel interface to the NAND—half what is typical for high-end NVMe SSDs. These restrictions combined with a 40nm fabrication process allow the E8 to be a much smaller and cheaper controller than those aiming for the high-end part of the market. To cut costs even further, drive makers can opt for the Phison E8T variant that drops the external DRAM interface. The E8T supports the NVMe Host Memory Buffer feature to mitigate the performance impact DRAMless SSDs usually suffer from, but the E8T hasn't caught on in the consumer SSD market yet.", "Despite its low-end role, the Phison E8 is in several ways more advanced than Phison's E7, their first NVMe SSD controller. Major improvements to the error correction capabilities have allowed the E8 to support 3D TLC NAND instead of being confined to the 15nm planar MLC used by E7 drives. The E8 and E8T controllers will also be joined by a high-end E12 controller later this year to round out Phison's second generation of NVMe controllers.", "This review will primarily compare the SBX against other recent NVMe SSDs, but a few SATA results are included for context.

With 8 NAND channels and a PCIe 3 x4 host interface, the 88SS1098 is the direct successor to the 88SS1093 Eldora and 88SS1092 Eldora Plus controllers for high-end client SSDs and low-end enterprise NVMe SSDs. Performance increases will be enabled primarily by the introduction of Marvell's fourth-generation LDPC error correction engine with improved throughput, and by a 50% increase in the maximum supported NAND interface speed. The new controller also adds a fourth ARM Cortex-R4 CPU core. The DRAM controller has been upgraded to support LPDDR4, which should help reduce power consumption of M.2 NVMe SSDs. Up to 8GB of DRAM is supported, matching the 88SS1092's primary advantage over the 88SS1093 that is limited to 2GB of DRAM.", "A number of new enterprise-oriented features have been added to Marvell's latest NVMe controllers. The PCIe host interface can be operated as a dual-port pair of PCIe 3 x2 links for high availability. SR-IOV virtualization support is included with support for up to 64 virtual instances of the controller. The new NVMe Streams and IO determinism features are supported, allowing drives to offer improved performance and endurance under mixed workloads when the host system's NVMe drivers support those features. Even without streams and IO determinism, latency QoS is improved by the migration of more controller functionality from the CPU cores to dedicated fixed-function hardware, and better support for suspending in-progress NAND program operations to perform a quicker read operation. The new controllers support a total of 132 queue pairs of up to 256 I/O commands in flight, so the controller can handle intense workloads and won't require host systems to share queues between CPU cores. QLC NAND is officially supported.", "", "The high-end alternative in Marvell's new controller generation is the new 88SS1088 controller. This is a dual-chip controller solution, essentially a pair of 88SS1098 controllers with a dedicated 4GB/s link between them. Only one of the two controller chips connects to the host system so drives based around the 88SS1088 solution will still be limited to a PCIe 3 x4 interface or dual-port PCIe 3 x2. However, the total supported DRAM and NAND is doubled, allowing for 16GB of DRAM and 16TB of NAND spread across a total of 16 channels.", "Drives using this dual-chip controller solution will appear to the host system as a single NVMe device and the host system will not have to implement its own software RAID-0 as required by products like the Intel P3608 that are essentially two separate SSDs sharing one circuit board. Performance from the 88SS1088 controller will be a bit higher than the 88SS1098 but the PCIe link will be a significant bottleneck at high queue depths. It is likely that the dual-chip design of the 88SS1088 puts it at a disadvantage relative to a monolithic single-die 16-channel controller design, but without a wider host interface the difference is unlikely to matter, and the 88SS1088 should be more economical than a massive native 16-channel controller. Marvell claims the 88SS1098 can deliver up to 700k random read IOPS and sequential reads of up to 3.6 GB/s, and the 88SS1088 can do about 800k random read IOPS.", "The 88S1098 and 88SS1088 use a common architecture for firmware, so drive makers can easily re-use most of their firmware code between those two controllers and future controllers in this generation from Marvell. No other controllers have been announced yet, but Marvell is certain to introduce at least one low-end controller for entry-level client SSDs, and larger controllers are also a possibility if the 88SS1088's dual-controller design isn't enough to satisfy high-end enterprise demand.", "In addition to a new generation of NVMe SSD controllers, Marvell has introduced a new category of NVMe chipset. The new Marvell 88NR2241 Intelligent NVMe Switch can replace some uses of PCIe switches: it has a PCIe x8 host interface, and up to four NVMe SSDs can be connected behind the switch. Unlike a regular PCIe switch, the SSDs behind the 88NR2241 switch are not individually accessible to the host system. Instead, the switch itself implements the NVMe 1.3 protocol and provides abstraction of the individual SSDs behind the switch. The storage of each of the individual SSDs can be presented to the host system as a separate namespace on the switch's NVMe controller, or the storage can be pooled with RAID 0,1 and 10 modes. Because the switch is the endpoint for NVMe transactions with the host system, it can provide advanced features that may not be supported by the individual SSDs, such as redundant dual-port support, multiple namespaces, SR-IOV virtualization, and NVMe-MI management support. The 88NR2241 implements the NVMe protocol but doesn't do any of the hard work of NAND flash management, so it is a very low-overhead intermediary and does not require any external DRAM. It may add slightly more latency than a simple PCIe switch would, but that extra latency is unlikely to matter to flash-based SSDs. Marvell has measured random read speeds of 1.6M IOPS and sequential speeds of 6.4GB/s using a PCIe 3 x8 host interface.", "", "The Marvell 88NR2241 can work in front of any standard NVMe SSDs, even those using competitors' controllers. One use case Marvell envisions is creating enterprise-grade storage solutions out of consumer-class NVMe controllers and SSDs. The Marvell 88NR2241 has relatively small port and lane counts compared the large fan-out PCIe switches used in many servers, and Marvell's switch is not aimed at entirely replacing those large switches. Instead, the 88NR2241 is likely to be used in smaller hot-swappable storage modules that may still connect to a fan-out switch, or directly to the CPU on platforms that have plenty of PCIe lanes. The 88NR2241 may be used with several SSD controllers on larger SSD form factors like the new EDSFF Long cards derived from the Intel Ruler, or on PCIe add-in cards as either a HBA with cables to SSDs, or with several SSD controllers on the same card. Smaller form factors like the Samsung NF1 and M.2 are unlikely to have enough room for the 88NR2241 to be worthwhile.", "", "Hardware RAID for NVMe has not been as popular as for drives using SATA and SAS interfaces. Part of the problem has been a dearth of controllers that can provide RAID functionality without imposing a performance bottleneck that eliminates the advantages of NVMe. Some recent top of the line RAID controllers from Broadcom/Avago/LSI can bond groups of four of their SAS/SATA links to connect to NVMe SSDs, but this leaves them with a disappointing port count and a few other inconvenient limitations. The Marvell 88NR2241 doesn't address all the demand for NVMe RAID capabilities (especially without RAID5/6 support), but it is a big step forward. Its compatibility with existing NVMe host drivers will make it very easy to deploy from a software perspective. Marvell didn't discuss future plans for other NVMe switches, but it is likely that they are planning larger variants to go after more of the traditional PCIe switch market and some of the SAS/SATA HBA market."]},

The Samsung 860 PRO is an update to the venerable 850 PRO SATA SSD, and comes at a time where Samsung faces more serious competition than they have in several years, but also when the market has almost entirely moved on from premium SATA SSDs. The 860 PRO uses the latest 64L 3D MLC NAND and LPDDR4 DRAM from Samsung plus a new revision to their highly successful SATA SSD controller series. Accordingly, the latest PRO SSD from Samsung isn't meant to be a game-changer like its predecessor, but rather is a natural evolution of Samsung's SATA SSDs – at least as much as SATA SSDs can evolve. For the SATA SSD market then, the 860 PRO stands to be the latest, greatest, fastest, and possibly last(est) high-end desktop MLC SATA SSD that we'll ever see.", "The Samsung SSD 850 PRO introduced 3D NAND flash memory to the consumer SSD market over three years ago. Since then, it has reigned as the top SATA SSD. The combination of Samsung's MLC 3D NAND and their top-notch SSD controller gave the 850 PRO performance and write endurance that were nearly unbeatable.", "The SSD market now is very different from when the 850 PRO launched in mid-2014. All the attention for premium SSDs is now focused on the NVMe market where significant performance differentiation is possible. The mainstream SSD market has shifted to using TLC NAND instead of MLC NAND, first in the SATA segment and now even most NVMe SSDs are adopting TLC. At first, the switch to TLC was a race to the bottom that left the 850 PRO almost completely unchallenged. In 2016, Intel and Micron brought the second 3D NAND implementation to market, but their 32-layer 3D floating gate NAND flash proved to be slower (though cheaper) than Samsung's. In 2017, Toshiba and Western Digital/SanDisk finally produced 3D NAND suitable for the mass market, and the second-generation 3D NAND from Intel/Micron debuted. With 64-layer 3D NAND and more mature SSD controllers, these competitors have finally started to challenge the performance of the Samsung 850 PRO—usually while beating it on price.", "Samsung hasn't been standing still. In addition to extending their dominance into the NVMe SSD market, Samsung has quietly updated the 850 PRO and 850 EVO without introducing new naming. In mid 2015, Samsung introduced 2TB models to both SATA families, and updated the controllers to support LPDDR3 DRAM instead of the LPDDR2 initially used by the 850s. Over the course of 2016, Samsung moved the 850s from their second-generation 32-layer 3D NAND to their third generation 48L 3D NAND. This brought a doubling of the capacity of each NAND die, and allowed Samsung to produce 4TB versions of the 850 PRO and EVO, though only the 4TB EVO actually made it to market.", "The changes the 860 PRO brings over the 850 PRO are pretty mundane. The controller has been updated again to support new memory: now codenamed MJX, it uses LPDDR4 DRAM. Samsung hasn't shared whether it deviates from their pattern of two or three ARM Cortex-R cores, nor what the clock speeds or fabrication process node are. The flash memory has been updated to Samsung's 64L 3D MLC, their fourth generation of 3D NAND. The Samsung 860 PRO is our first look at Samsung's 64-layer MLC V-NAND, after several encounters with the 64L TLC last year. Both 860 PRO models we have tested use 256Gb dies that are substantially larger than the 256Gb 64L TLC dies we have used previously.", "The most visible change is that Samsung is finally launching the 4TB capacity in the PRO line. The 4TB model may turn heads, but it should not be mistaken for a mainstream product. It is a product born from the same mindset that leads to the GeForce Titan GPUs, Extreme Edition or Threadripper CPUs, and 1.5kW power supplies. The total available market for such products is tiny and often insufficient to justify creating the product. Instead, these parts are valuable for their halo effect: Samsung's ability to offer a 4TB SSD helps their brand image even among consumers who cannot afford to spend anywhere near this much on their SSD.", "Aside from the inclusion of the 4TB model, there is little to make the 860 PRO appear superior to the 850 PRO. Power consumption ratings have decreased slightly, but the limits of the SATA connection mean there is little room for performance improvement. The warranty period has dropped from the outstanding 10 years to a more typical 5 years. On the other hand, Samsung has stopped severely lowballing the write endurance rating. At every capacity, the 860 PRO's total write endurance rating is at least doubled, and given the shorter warranty period this yields a drive writes per day rating of 0.64, compared to a maximum of 0.16 DWPD over 10 years for the 850 PRO. The write endurance ratings are still lower than the enterprise PM863a to say nothing of the SM863a's 5.5 DWPD, but among consumer drives the 860 PRO's specified endurance no longer looks like a joke.", "The other noteworthy recent MLC SATA drive is the Crucial BX300. This drive conveniently solved several problems for Micron. Since their 32L 3D NAND dies can be treated either as 384Gb TLC or 256Gb MLC, the BX300 gives Micron an outlet to sell dies that cannot meet the endurance requirements for use as TLC. At the same time, the smaller usable capacity of their MLC parts makes them more suitable for use in low-capacity SSDs. The Samsung 860 PRO isn't as convenient for Samsung to produce—they have little use for the 64L 256Gb MLC parts elsewhere in their product line so far, nor for a 384Gb TLC part.", "There aren't any many SSDs to make a fair comparison against the Samsung 860 PRO, especially the 4TB model.

Those drives include:", "The 860 PRO is going to be the most expensive SATA drive in this bunch, and even the one NVMe drive is probably not going to be much more expensive per gigabyte than the 860 PRO when its retail version arrives.

The 4TB PRO model is finally being released, but there are no further capacity increases coming at this time, and the entry level is still the same 250/256GB.", "Looking at the numbers, the performance specifications are barely changed from the 850 series, and this is because the SATA interface hasn't gotten any faster since the 850 was introduced. The write endurance ratings have been simplified however: write endurance is now proportional to drive capacity even at the high end, and the 860 PRO's endurance is twice that of the 860 EVO's at each capacity point.", "The most notable change is the reduction of the PRO's warranty period from the outstanding 10 years down to the same 5 years as the 860 EVO. The other big surprise is that there will be mSATA versions of the 860 EVO; this is the first major new mSATA SSD in a long time, as most product lines have abandoned it in favor of M.2 SATA. The 860 EVO will introduce a 2TB option to Samsung's M.2 SATA lineup.", "For the first few years, the Samsung 850 PRO and 850 EVO were essentially unchallenged in the SATA SSD market. All of their most successful competitors were slower and cheaper, because nobody could match Samsung's performance. That changed in 2017 when several of Samsung's biggest competitors beat them to the introduction of 64L 3D NAND in the consumer SATA market. Drives like the Intel 545s, SanDisk Ultra3D and Crucial MX500 have renewed competition for mainstream consumer SSDs by matching or beating Samsung's performance while putting pressure on their pricing. Samsung's response is due. By keeping the MLC-based PRO tier while their competition is almost entirely switching to TLC NAND, Samsung will likely hold on to some performance crowns with their premium product, and they'll have the highest write endurance. But the more mainstream 860 EVO will have to fight for its place in the market.", "Samsung's decision to keep the PRO tier around and based on MLC NAND signals that they will almost certainly do the same for their PCIe SSDs. Whatever they introduce as the successor to the 960 PRO will probably stand out from the crowd in a way that their premium SATA SSDs cannot.

This isn't necessary unless the SSD has been powered off for a long time, but the drive has no way to know how long it was without power. The documentation for the 750GB Optane SSD DC P4800X states this process can take up to three hours. We have not observed any clear transition in idle power during the first few hours after power-on, but there are occasional short periods where idle power drops by around 350-400mW (from around 3.5W).", "Without a conclusive indication of whether background data refresh is happening and influencing benchmark results, we've re-tested the 280GB Optane SSD 900p for this review. Before running the synthetic benchmarks, the 900p was allowed to sit at idle for at least three hours. The ATSB tests were also conducted after an extended idle period, but the test system was rebooted between ATSB tests. Even with this precaution, there's still significant variability between test runs on the Optane SSD 900p and the full-drive performance is often better than freshly erased, so it appears there's another factor contributing to this behavior."]},

As the latest MX series drive, the MX500 is positioned to be a mainstream product with solid performance but without much of a premium over entry-level SSDs. Since Micron has not yet released a consumer NVMe SSD, the Crucial MX500 will also serve as their flagship consumer drive and the showcase for their new 64-layer 3D NAND flash memory.", "Micron is one of several NAND flash manufacturers to introduce 64L 3D NAND this year. They're a bit late to the party considering that their NAND manufacturing partner Intel introduced started shipping their 64L 3D TLC in a retail drive six months ago, but Micron hasn't missed their chance. All of the major NAND flash manufacturers except SK Hynix are still in the early phases of rolling out their 64L 3D NAND. In a major change from the state of the industry for the past several years, there's no clear leader: Intel and Micron, Toshiba and Western Digital/SanDisk, and Samsung are all putting out products with competitive performance and pricing. The market is up for grabs, and the SATA segment that still makes up the bulk of consumer SSD sales is where the competition is fiercest.", "To prepare for this next round of competition, the Crucial MX500 brings major hardware changes to what has been a slowly evolving product line stretching back to the first 6Gbps SATA SSD.", "Micron has struggled a bit in recent years to come up with a clear strategy for their retail Crucial-branded SSDs. Their MX series originally hit the market with the ", " budget drive that had high enough performance to have very broad appeal. The ", " tried to move upmarket with increased performance, and the BX series was introduced beneath it as the entry-level alternative. Micron was unable to match the performance of the top SATA SSDs with their Crucial MX200, leaving it very close to the ", " in price and performance, and their ", " was a serious disappointment. As the high end of the SSD market has shifted from SATA to NVMe drives, it has become harder to make a case for maintaining two tiers of consumer SATA SSD products.", "The MX300 has been a solid choice for many use cases and budgets, but it hasn't been able to effectively serve the entire range of the SATA SSD market. Earlier this year, Micron introduced the ", " as more of a niche product, specializing in performance at smaller capacities through the use of 3D MLC at surprisingly low prices. Today, Micron is skipping over the MX400 name entirely and introducing the MX500 with major changes under the hood that may allow it to be a solid replacement for both the MX300 and BX300 as they are phased out.", "The 32L Intel/Micron 3D TLC used in drives like the Crucial MX300 was cheap and low-power, but didn't perform as well as Samsung's 3D NAND so it largely displaced planar TLC products and left Samsung's 850 EVO and 850 PRO almost unchallenged for performance. Our testing of the Intel 545s revealed that their second generation 3D NAND had improved on many fronts, but one model doesn't move the market all that much. The arrival of Micron's 64L NAND in the MX500 means many other companies will soon be using that NAND in their own drives.", "Micron's launch strategy for the MX500 is similar to their launch of the MX300. We get one capacity today (1TB) and the rest of the lineup will be unveiled soon. The MX300 will be phased out relatively quickly as the MX500 lineup makes its way through the supply chain, but the BX300 will stick around a bit longer. Specific discontinuation dates haven't been provided, but I expect the BX300 to remain in production for several more months at least. Micron hasn't disclosed any plans for a BX400 or BX500 and instead they will probably let the BX line drop again until another niche opportunity comes along like the MX300's weakness at lower capacities.", "The NAND flash isn't the only significant hardware change the MX500 brings. Micron has broken the trend of using Marvell SSD controllers in the MX series and instead chosen the Silicon Motion SM2258. Silicon Motion controllers have been used in all of the BX series drives and even beyond Micron's products, SMI controllers tend to be more popular for budget products while Marvell's controllers are usually found in more expensive and higher-performing SSDs. Silicon Motion has been working to improve their controllers and move toward the high end, but the MX500 isn't even adopting the newer SM2259 controller Intel uses in the 545s. Micron says that the improvements in the SM2259 are more relevant for enterprise SSDs and that the SM2258 is good enough, when paired with their new 3D NAND.", "In spite of the completely different controller, the MX500 offers all the standard features of the MX series. TCG Opal encryption is included (making this the first SMI drive we've tested with full self-encrypting drive capability). Micron's partial power loss protection feature for data at rest is preserved, but implemented in a different fashion; they're now also branding it as power loss immunity. The impact is still the same: you don't get the full protection that is standard for enterprise SSDs, but data that has already been written to the flash will not be corrupted if the drive loses power while writing a second pass of more data to the same cells. This is a feature that can only exist for drives storing more than one bit per memory cell (ie. MLC or TLC, but not SLC), and not using a one-shot programming sequence like is possible with Toshiba/SanDisk 3D NAND.", "Previous MX series drives have included banks of capacitors to provide power for a short while after an unexpected loss of external power supply. Micron's 64L 3D TLC substantially reduces the need for extra capacitors by offering a much more efficient NAND programing sequence, and by providing significant capacitance within the NAND package itself. The MX500 still includes more capacitors on its PCB than most consumer drives, but they're not as large or numerous as on previous MX series drives. This reduction in BOM suggests that we may see other users of Micron flash implement an equivalent feature in their own products.", "As with the MX300 and some MX200 models, the MX500 includes SLC write caching to accelerate bursty workloads.", "The performance specifications for the 1TB MX500 don't reveal any particularly interesting changes; most SATA SSDs claim something around these numbers based on unrealistic assumptions about queue depths and I/O sizes. The specs for power consumption have been reduced slightly. The MX300 was very power efficient, but it wasn't reflected that well in its basic specifications. Endurance has increased substantially to 360 TB, above even what the MLC-based 1TB MX200 offered. The warranty period has also been extended to five years, so the drive writes per day rating is not actually any better.", "The introductory price of $259.99 is a bit higher than what the MX300 debuted with, but is pretty good considering how much flash prices have increased overall since then.", "Micron's spec sheet indicates there will be a M.2 2280 version of the 1TB MX500, but it will be a double-sided drive. Most manufacturers try to make their 1TB models single-sided these days so they can fit into all the same notebooks that the smaller capacities work with, and Samsung has even managed to make their 2TB 960 PRO a single-sided drive.", "The 1TB MX500's PCB seems a bit larger than necessary, with 16 NAND flash packages each containing two of Micron's 256Gb 64L 3D TLC dies. With just a four-channel controller, the only reason to split the NAND across so many packages is to save on packaging costs that come from stacking the NAND higher within a package. The partial power loss protection capacitors can be seen encircling the NAND package clusters, rather than being arrayed elsewhere on the PCB.", "The switch to 64L 3D NAND means Micron is back to a nominal flash die capacity that is a power of two, so the unusual capacities and overprovisioning ratios of the MX300 are gone. The MX500 1TB has the standard capacity for a 1000GB drive, and the flash can be evenly balanced across the controller's four channels.", "The competition for the Crucial MX500 will consist primarily of other SATA SSDs using 3D NAND. Now that Toshiba/SanDisk 3D NAND is also shipping, we expect most brands still using planar NAND to soon discontinue those products in favor of successors using either Micron or Toshiba NAND.", "Samsung's ", " and ", " are still among the top SATA SSDs and the 850 EVO has at times offered great performance for its price, but they're no longer alone at the top.

Since the test normally takes at least 12 hours for a SATA SSD to complete, this isn't something easily debugged over the course of just a day or two. This issue is affecting the MX500 and the few other drives I've had time to attempt running The Destroyer on recently, so this review will be missing results from that test until I can get the testbed re-imaged and collect and validate new performance results. The other tests in our suite seem to be unaffected, and the MX500 results that appear to be outliers have already been double-checked."]},

Neither product is a direct replacement for one of their current consumer SSDs; instead, the new RC100 and XS700 expand into new market segments for Toshiba. Both drives feature Toshiba's 64-layer BiCS 3 3D TLC NAND flash memory.", "The new RC100 NVMe SSD is a consumer derivative of the ", " for the OEM market. As an entry-level DRAMless NVMe SSD with a PCIe x2 connection, the RC100 is part of the emerging category of budget NVMe SSDs with a minimal price premium over mainstream SATA SSDs. Its competition will be the Intel 600p and a growing number of products based on the Phison E8 or Silicon Motion SM2263XT controllers. Like the BG3, the Toshiba RC100 is manufactured as a single 16mm by 20mm BGA package integrating the SSD controller and the NAND flash memory. To make it accessible for DIY consumer upgrades or system builds, the RC100 is mounted on a M.2 2242 card—shorter than the 2280 size used by most M.2 SSDs, but still widely supported by many laptops and desktop motherboards. (The BG3 as available on an even smaller M.2 2230 card, but Toshiba determined that too few consumer systems can accommodate an aftermarket upgrade in that size.)", "Because the RC100 connects to the host system through just two PCIe lanes instead of four, its connector is notched for installation into either M.2 type M or type B slots, rather than just the type M used for SSDs supporting a PCIe x4 connection. This makes the RC100 hard to tell visually distinguish from a M.2 SATA SSD, and it will be mechanically compatible with M.2 SATA slots that may not provide any PCIe connectivity.", "Despite not having the full PCIe x4 connection that high-end NVMe SSDs use, the Toshiba RC100's x2 connection is plenty for it to offer sequential transfer speeds twice as fast as SATA SSDs. The random access speeds of the RC100 are only a little bit higher than SATA SSDs, but the RC100 hits those speeds in spite of being a DRAMless SSD, thanks to the NVMe Host Memory Buffer (HMB) feature. When used with a supporting NVMe driver—either the one built in to Windows 10, or the driver Toshiba will be supplying for earlier versions of Windows—the RC100 will by default use 38MB of the host system's DRAM to cache the drive's mapping information about which logical block addresses are stored in which physical chip locations. That 38MB buffer is sufficient to cache metadata for about 32GB of the drive's storage, allowing the RC100 to handle everyday workloads at nearly the same speed as a comparable drive with its own DRAM. Random access to a much larger portion of the drive will still show the characteristic performance hit of a DRAMless SSD, but that won't be matter much to the RC100's intended audience. The HMB feature is optional and the RC100 is fully functional with systems that do not support or enable HMB, but at reduced speeds (mostly for random I/O).", "In addition to being more compact and affordable than most current NVMe SSDs, the RC100 also promises to be more power efficient. The lack of DRAM or a DRAM controller saves quite a bit of power even after accounting for the slightly increased PCIe traffic when HMB is in use. The other SSDs we've tested with Toshiba's BiCS 3 3D TLC NAND have offered great power efficiency, and we expect the RC100 to follow suit. ", "The Toshiba XS700 is their first portable SSD, and is something of a me too product—almost everyone is making USB drives that are internally using an existing SATA SSD design with a USB bridge. The Toshiba XS700 will use a USB 3.1 Gen 2 connection with a Type-C connector and will ship with a Type-A adapter. Because it is internally a 6Gbps SATA SSD, the XS700 won't be able to use the full 10Gbps speed of its USB link, but neither can most other portable SSDs: so far, nobody has made a native 10Gbps USB SSD controller and few companies have been willing to bear the cost of a SATA RAID design for what is still a fairly small market segment.

This ensures that the operating system's standard storage drivers won't be able to access the drives, so there's no danger of the array being accidentally corrupted by an OS that isn't aware the drive is part of an array. When Intel added NVMe RAID to their consumer platform with the Sunrise Point 100-series chipsets accompanying Skylake processors, they included a similar mechanism that hides NVMe devices that are connected through the chipset and instead makes them accessible through non-standard interfaces on the SATA controller.", "For Intel's X299 HEDT platform for Skylake-X, the same chipset RAID capabilities are available, but the more interesting feature is Intel's Virtual RAID on CPU (VROC) for NVMe SSDs attached to the CPU's PCIe lanes. VROC is a software RAID system that builds atop the Intel Volume Management Device (VMD) feature of Skylake-X and Skylake-SP processors. VMD allows some of the CPU's PCIe ports to be partitioned off into a separate PCI domain behind a virtual PCI bridge. VMD has largely been described by Intel as a feature intended to simplify support for hotplug and enclosure management (status LEDs) of NVMe SSDs, but it apparently also helps build a robust software RAID stack. Intel has not shared much technical information about how VROC works, but they have announced that its features will be segmented by requiring the purchase of a hardware key to unlock RAID capability, and a premium key to unlock RAID-5.", "AMD has not described any features of their Zen architecture that sound particularly similar to Intel's VMD or the NVMe remapping feature of Intel's consumer platform chipsets, so it's not clear what hardware features (if any) are helping to enable their NVMe RAID implementation. From a user perspective, setting up NVMe RAID is very similar to setting up chipset SATA RAID: configure the array through the motherboard firmware and load an extra driver when installing Windows. Unlike Intel's plans for VROC, AMD isn't trying for any extra product segmentation and isn't charging extra for any of their NVMe RAID functionality.", "One important warning: the new RAID system is incompatible with the previous SATA RAID system for X399. Users with an existing SATA RAID array will not be able to access it using the new RAID drivers. The only migration path AMD currently offers is to re-create the array using the new drivers and firmware, and restore the data from a back-up. For users booting off a RAID array, this means re-installing Windows."]},

To that end, they have wholeheartedly embraced the use of 3D MLC NAND even as most brands are using the 3D NAND transition to entirely remove MLC from their consumer product lines or relegate it to niche models instead of treating it as the mainstream default. ADATA is selling multiple SATA and NVMe models using Micron's first-generation 3D MLC NAND. On the SATA side of things, they have the Ultimate SU900 and XPG SX950 as the MLC models (positioned above the SU800 and SU700 using 3D TLC). For the NVMe market, they have the XPG SX8000 and XPG SX9000 pairing 3D MLC with Silicon Motion and Marvell controllers respectively. So far, all of their 3D NAND SSDs have relied on Micron's first-generation 32-layer 3D NAND, the only 3D NAND available in volume on the open market.", "The ADATA XPG SX950 is their top of the line SATA SSD. Technologically, it is very similar to their Ultimate SU900: both use the same Micron 3D MLC NAND and Silicon Motion SM2258 controller. The SX950 is distinguished by reserving more spare area (yielding usable capacities like 480GB instead of 512GB) and a six-year warranty instead of five. There may be significant firmware tuning differences, but there are no obvious signs such as one model providing TCG Opal encryption support (both lack that feature). ADATA did their own NAND packaging for the SX950, so it may be using flash binned for better endurance. The SU900 has a 2TB model listed but not yet available, while the SX950 line only goes up to 960GB, with limited availability of the largest model.", "The construction of the ADATA XPG SX950 is similar to ADATA's other recent SATA SSDs: a metal base and plastic lid are joined by a single screw through the center of the drive. The PCB occupies only half of the case, and has pads for eight NAND packages and two DRAM packages. On our 480GB sample, all eight NAND pads are occupied with dual-die packages, for a total raw capacity of 512GB.", "Micron recently re-introduced MLC NAND to their consumer product line with the Crucial BX300, using their 32L 3D MLC and the SM2258 controller. The Crucial BX300 is positioned as more of an entry-level model, with a focus on lower capacities that cannot perform well when using their 3D TLC. The ADATA SX950 has twice the warranty period and up to five times the rated write endurance, but any performance differences will come down to firmware tweaks, and ADATA hasn't updated the firmware since the SX950 launched earlier this year. Current pricing for the SX950 shows that ADATA has not responded to the introduction of the BX300: for the two capacities where the models match up, the ADATA is more expensive by 25% and 45%. That's quite a premium for a longer warranty."]},

The Trion/TR series has been Toshiba's entry-level SSD line since their acquisition of OCZ. The Trion 100 was Toshiba's first retail TLC SSD. In moving away from MLC NAND flash, the Trion 100 sacrificed performance and write endurance for the sake of affordability. The Trion 150 moved the lineup to Toshiba's 15nm TLC and delivered increased performance and lower prices. With the TR200, Toshiba is again making major changes that sacrifice performance for lower prices.", "We've seen with the ", " and with ", " that the 64-layer BiCS3 3D TLC NAND doesn't have a performance problem. What slows down the Toshiba TR200 is the switch to a DRAMless SSD controller. The Trion 100 and Trion 150 both used Phison's S10 SSD controller under Toshiba branding. The TR200 uses Phison's S11 controller, a substantially smaller and cheaper controller, but also more modern with official support for 3D NAND and LDPC error correction. Where the Phison S10 was an 8-channel controller built on a 55nm process, the S11 has a mere two channels and is fabbed on a 40nm process. The S11 controller's limitations mean we won't be seeing a 2TB model added to the TR200 family.", "The direct successor to the Phison S10 will be the S12 controller, but it isn't quite ready to hit the market. Toshiba has said they plan for the TR200 to be their only retail SATA SSD to use the 64L BiCS3 3D TLC, so we don't expect an S12-based drive from Toshiba to show up anytime soon. Instead, it appears that Toshiba and their somewhat estranged manufacturing partner SanDisk will be going after different ends of the SATA SSD market.", "Officially, Toshiba doesn't tell us much about the specific chips in their SSDs. They never officially confirmed that the earlier Trion series SSDs were using the Phison S10 controller despite an identical PCB layout to competing Phison drives, and they haven't confirmed that the Phison S11 is what's hiding under the Toshiba markings in the TR200, but the firmware version numbering matches other S11 drives. The secrecy also applies somewhat to the NAND configuration. Officially, both their 256Gb die and 512Gb die are used in the TR200 series. Unofficially, Toshiba seems to have done little to change their part numbering scheme over the past decade, so it looks like the 960GB TR200 is the only one using the 512Gb parts. This means that the 960GB model doesn't have much potential for a performance advantage over the 480GB model, because both have a total of 16 NAND flash dies spread across the controller's two channels.", "The construction of the Toshiba TR200 is very similar to other recent Phison SSDs, but the labeling is very different from the Trion 100 and 150. Toshiba has been phasing out the use of the OCZ brand, and the TR200 drops all use of the name from the drive itself, though OCZ is still mentioned on the box. The drive does still have an OCZ logo, though the color scheme has switched from blue and white to green and black.", "As can be expected from a DRAMless SSD, the PCB inside doesn't take up much space, even with Toshiba using just one or two NAND dies per package. There are four packages on each side of the PCB, each of which dwarfs the controller package and all the smaller components.", "The MSRPs for the TR200 aren't groundbreaking and are in fact much higher than what the Trion 150 was going for when it was new, but that's due to the NAND flash shortage that has driven prices up over the past year. When the Trion 150 launched, the best deals were around 20 ¢/GB. Now, 27 cents/GB is hard to beat, and the MSRPs for the TR200 start at 30 ¢/GB. With the Trion 100 and Trion 150, Toshiba kept prices fairly competitive, though usually not quite the lowest on the market. They'll probably do the same with the TR200, and may be a bit more aggressive given the cheaper DRAMless design.", "Now that Toshiba's 3D NAND is showing up in volume, the situation should improve. Intel/Micron and Samsung are also ramping up production of their respective 64L 3D NAND, and SK Hynix might return to relevance if their 72-layer 3D NAND ends up affordable and readily available. There's no definite timeline for prices getting back to their 2015/2016 lows, but the price increases are probably pretty much over now.", "As a DRAMless SSD, the TR200 doesn't quite fit in the same market segment as most of the entry-level SSDs from Toshiba's competitors. DRAMless SSDs haven't been very popular with the major SSD brands of the North American and European markets, because they have historically not offered enough of a discount to offset the performance hit. Nonetheless, the Toshiba TR200 will be in close competition with drives using larger controllers with DRAM.

{"title": "The Toshiba XG5 (1TB) SSD Review", "paragraph": ["For several years, 3D NAND flash memory has promised to bring improvements to the performance, endurance and cost of SSDs. Samsung was the first to deliver 3D NAND and they have dominated the market ever since with the fastest consumer SSDs and the highest capacities. Last year, Intel and Micron shipped their first generation of 3D NAND and started providing stronger competition for Samsung in a few market segments, but price improvements were forestalled by the onset of an industry-wide shortage of NAND flash memory. Meanwhile, Toshiba, Western Digital/SanDisk, and SK Hynix talked a lot about their 3D NAND technology but shipped very little. A few memory cards and smartphones last year used 3D NAND, but Toshiba's first SSD with 3D NAND didn't enter mass production until around the beginning of this year, and it was a low-volume niche product.", "Toshiba's 3D NAND, now in its third generation, is finally ready for primetime. Their first SSD based on their 64-layer BiCS3 3D NAND is the XG5 client NVMe SSD for the OEM market. Using their 3D TLC NAND, the XG5 is intended as the successor to both their XG3 and XG4 SSDs, which use 15nm planar MLC and TLC respectively. The trend of replacing planar MLC with 3D TLC is widespread across all segments of the SSD market, even for high-end enterprise SSDs. The general consensus has been that the extra capacity of TLC can make up for its performance disadvantages once the switch to 3D NAND has reduced those disadvantages. In the client space, the use of SLC write caching completely eliminates the penalty to write performance provided the workload's writes fit in that cache. Overall, Toshiba's decision to make the TLC-based XG5 their high-end OEM NVMe offering is no surprise.", "The XG5 was ", " and was officially ", ". The XG5 seems to have been the first 64-layer 3D NAND SSD to start shipping, but since it is an OEM product working its way through the suppy chain, it is still hard for consumers to acquire. Intel launched their 64-layer 3D NAND with the ", " at the end of June and it managed to be the first 64L 3D NAND with retail availability. Since then, Western Digital has also announced their first 3D NAND SSDs, Toshiba announced ", ", and today Toshiba is ", ". SK Hynix is still pretty quiet, but otherwise the SSD industry is finally reaching the point where most products will be based on 3D NAND. Planar NAND won't disappear for quite a while, but as production of 64L 3D NAND ramps up most brands will introduce their most significant product updates in years.", "The Toshiba XG5 is intended to ride the wave of increasing NVMe adoption by OEMs. It uses the single-sided M.2 form factor preferred for notebooks and offers capacities from 256GB to 1TB. Higher capacities would be possible using this 3D NAND, but given the current shortage they would be too expensive for most consumers. The controller supports a PCIe 3.1 x4 link and complies with version 1.2.1 of the NVMe specification. Based on the chip markings (TC58NCP090GSD) it appears to be an updated version of the controller used by the XG3 and RD400 (TC58NCP070GSB), with a switch from plastic packaging to exposed-die flip chip packaging. The die size is approximately 39mm². The only performance specifications provided are for sequential transfers, but they're pretty aggressive for a TLC-based SSD. Toshiba wants the XG5 to cover a broad portion of the OEM SSD market.", "We're still in the process of rolling out our new 2017 SSD test suite to replace the 2015 test suite. Our AnandTech Storage Bench (ATSB) tests based on real-world workloads are largely unchanged though we're reporting some of the results a bit differently. Our suite of synthetic tests has been overhauled to be more streamlined and less susceptible to producing unrealistic results due to thermal throttling or SLC write caches filling up. Most of the drives that have been tested so far are PCIe SSDs, so this review does not include any SATA drives for comparison in the graphs. This review compares the 1TB Toshiba XG5 against the following competitors:", " "]},

Meanwhile, the TBW ratings of the drives range from 100 TBW for the 250 GB models to 500 TBW for the 2TB models.

With the client SSD for OEMs segments covered by the ", ", ", " and with the ", " covering the retail SATA market, Toshiba now turns to the enterprise SSD market with a new generation of NVMe and SAS SSDs. The PM5 SAS SSD and CM5 NVMe SSD are based on a new generation of SSD controllers that use the same architecture for both NVMe and SAS, allowing the two product families to share several key features.", "The PM5 SAS SSD sets new records by offering capacities of up to 30.72 TB in a 2.5 form factor, and sequential transfer speeds of up to 3350 MB/s (reads) thanks to support for four-port SAS MultiLink. SAS has always supported dual-port drives, with the two ports either used in a failover configuration for high availability or bonded for high throughput. When SAS devices were still at 6Gbps there was serious discussion of going beyond two ports per drive and backwards-compatible connectors were standardized, but 12Gbps SAS won out as the preferred next step toward higher throughput. Now that NVMe SSDs using four or more PCIe lanes are providing heavy competition, MultiLink SAS has been dusted off and is being implemented on a SSD for the first time. Existing backplanes will need to be upgraded to physically provide the extra lanes, but otherwise the SAS ecosystem is ready to support 4-port MultiLink drives more or less transparently, since multi-lane/multi-path IO support is already ubiquitous.", "The CM5 enterprise NVMe SSD will only offer capacities of up to 15.36TB but higher performance than its SAS cousin, including up to twice the random read performance. It supports the latest and greatest NVMe features: scatter-gather lists and Controller Memory Buffer (CMB) for more efficient NVMe over Fabrics use, multiple namespaces and SR-IOV virtualization, and NVMe Management Interface.  The CM5 is also previewing a new Persistent Memory Region (PMR) feature that is on track for standardization. The PMR feature appears be an extension of the Controller Memory Buffer feature. CMB allows a NVMe SSD to expose a portion of its DRAM for general-purpose use by other parts of the system. The most common use case so far is with NVMe over Fabrics (NVMeoF) where an RDMA-capable NIC can store data and queued commands straight into the SSD's DRAM with peer-to-peer DMA, eliminating a round-trip to the CPU's DRAM. PMR envisions a different use for the SSD's DRAM by ensuring the buffer's contents are saved to the flash in the event of power loss. This allows the host system to treat the buffer in much the same manner as a NVDIMM providing battery-backed DRAM. The performance of a single drive's PMR won't be competitive with a NVDIMM due to a PCIe x4 link being much slower than a DDR4 bus, but it will provide a small pool of persistent memory that is faster than the drive's block storage accessed through NVMe.", "Both the PM5 and CM5 implement their host interface's respective standard for streams support, allowing I/O commands to be tagged according to which task they originate from. This allows the SSD to write each task's data to separate parts of the drive, which makes it easier to offer higher and more consistent performance and also can lead to much lower write amplification as data with similar lifetimes is physically grouped together instead of being interleaved within the same erase blocks. The PM5 and CM5 also both support TCG encryption and the relatively new Sanitize command to securely erase not just the flash but all other buffers on the drive, which was not ensured by previous erase methods.", "The PM5 SAS SSD will be available in capacities from 800GB to 30.72TB, with endurance ratings of 1, 3, 5 and 10 Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD). The CM5 NVMe SSD will be available in capacities from 400GB to 15.36TB with endurance ratings of 1, 3 and 5 DWPD. Both drives use Toshiba's 64-layer TLC BiCS3 3D NAND and are currently sampling to select OEM customers. The timeline for wider availability has not been announced.

The Nytro 5000 is still a M.2 22110 card with power loss protection and maximum power of 8.25W, roughly the practical limit for M.2 SSDs without extreme cooling. Compared to the Nytro XM1440, the Nytro 5000 series roughly doubles random write performance, but it's still a read-focused product. Capacities now range from 400GB to 1.92TB, providing two write endurance/overprovisioning levels at each of three raw capacity points.

Instead, Seagate's third new SSD being exhibited here at Flash Memory Summit is a technology demonstration that combines elements of ", ". Seagate has built an ultra-high capacity 64TB SSD using 3D TLC NAND. Unlike last year's 60TB SSD demo, this won't be constrained by a SAS interface and instead uses a PCIe 3 x16 interface. Internally, the 64TB SSD uses eight M.2 SSDs each with a PCIe 3 x4 link to the drive's built-in PCIe switch. Last year's quad-M.2 demo didn't include a PCIe switch and thus relied on the host to provide a x16 slot that supported bifurcation into four x4 ports. This year with new server CPU platforms offering far more PCIe lanes, that lack of a PCIe switch is less of a limitation, but it still reduces the potential viability as a product. The new 64TB NVMe drive can not only operate in any PCIe x16 slot (even those that are electrically only x8 or narrower), it can come much closer to saturating the x16 link. The M.2 SSDs that make up the 64TB drive cannot saturate their own x4 links, but in aggregate they can deliver sequential read speeds of 13GB/s at QD8 and random reads of 2M IOPS at QD64."]},

Aspects that may influence this include thermal throttling and firmware caps on access rates to avoid overheating or other similar scenarios. This aspect is an important one, as the last thing that users want to see when copying over, say, 100 GB of data to the flash drive, is the transfer rate going to USB 2.0 speeds. In order to identify whether the drive under test suffers from this problem, we instrumented our robocopy DAS benchmark suite to record the flash drive's read and write transfer rates while the robocopy process took place in the background. For supported drives, we also recorded the internal temperature of the drive during the process. The graphs below show the speeds observed during our real-world DAS suite processing. The first three sets of writes and reads correspond to the photos suite. A small gap (for the transfer of the videos suite from the primary drive to the RAM drive) is followed by three sets for the next data set. Another small RAM-drive transfer gap is followed by three sets for the Blu-ray folder.", "An important point to note here is that each of the first three blue and green areas correspond to 15.6 GB of writes and reads respectively. Throttling, if any, is apparent within the processing of the photos suite itself. ", "Despite getting quite hot in our performance consistency test (more than 70C), the drive doesn't throttle. Thermal issues are definitely a concern in all water / dust-proof external SSDs, and the ADATA SD700 is no different. Consumers would do well to not subject sealed SSDs (such as this one and the SanDisk Extreme 510) to extremely heavy workloads.", "The SD700 continues ADATA's tradition of bring external SSDs with good value for money to the market. As icing on the cake, the SD700 carries an IP68 rating also.", "The performance of the drive leaves us with no doubt that it would be a great portable OS drive, even though ADATA doesn't advertise it for that purpose. After all, we have a real SSD inside - the Ultimate SU800. The JMicron bridge chip is also able to map the SCSI Unmap commands to TRIM, as our little test below shows.", "​", "Moving on to the pricing, the SD700 comes in at $209. In terms of cost per GB, we find that ADATA is beat only by G-Technology / SanDisk / Western Digital, which has its own flash manufacturing facility.", "It is difficult to source IP68-rated enclosures into which one can put their own 2.5 drive. Therefore, going the DIY route to create a compact product like the ADATA SD700 with all its features is not going to be a feasible solution for the product's target market. ​ADATA must be given credit for being one of the first companies to bring 3D NAND to consumers in a IP68-rated product.", "​"]},

{"title": "The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X (375GB) Review: Testing 3D XPoint Performance", "paragraph": ["The potential significance of 3D XPoint memory is immense. When it was first publicly announced by Intel and Micron in 2015, 3D XPoint memory was a fundamentally different storage technology from the flash memory that dominates the market. It is the first new truly mass market, high-density solid state storage medium to hit the market since NAND flash itself. It comes at a time where the NAND market is booming like never before, but also at a time when we know that there is a definite end of the line for NAND. The ongoing transition to 3D NAND flash is just a temporary postponement of the fundamental limitations of flash memory. Once NAND can no longer scale in density and cost-per-bit, it will fall to paradigm changes and next-generation memory technologies (one of which will be 3D XPoint) to continue to carry the industry forward. There are many other new memory technologies that may compete alongside flash memory and 3D XPoint in the coming years, but 3D XPoint is the one that's ready to go mainstream now.", "In the near term, 3D XPoint is important because it offers a new set of performance tradeoffs entirely unlike NAND; tradeoffs that, for the right applications, can deliver performance far in excess of today's NAND products. By being able to read and write at the bit or word level - and not the 4K+ page level of NAND - 3D XPoint has the potential to deliver excellent performance across a wide range of workloads, but especially in minimally parallel workloads, which are common in the consumer and enterprise spaces.", "The drawback here is that, due to various factors regarding time, production, and scope, 3D XPoint is more expensive than NAND. It also comes in as less dense, to aid in ease of production in this first stage, but this also adds to the cost. For now, due to scale and other factors, it won't be able to replicate the sheer capacity and cost effectiveness that has made NAND storage so popular in all market segments. Due to the scale, especially as a first-generation version of the technology, the first 3D XPoint products are being aimed at speciality and high-margin markets: enterprise performance, consumer caching, etc. Future products promised from Intel should add non-volatile DIMMs to the mix, and then later on, if everything goes to plan, a potential wholesale replacement of NAND flash (or at least a strong competitor).", "The new storage drive, and the focus of today's review, is the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. It uses a new NVMe controller Intel developed specifically for use with 3D XPoint memory. Where Intel's enterprise NVMe SSDs like the ", " use a controller with 18 channels for interfacing to their flash memory, the Optane SSD's controller has only 7 channels. In order to achieve at least parity on peak performance, each of those channels has to provide much higher throughput than on a flash SSD, and it shows that each 3D XPoint memory die is delivering much higher performance than a die of flash memory.", "The first capacity of the Optane SSD DC P4800X to ship and the model we've tested here offers a usable capacity of 375GB from a total of 28 3D XPoint memory dies (four per channel) for a raw capacity of 448GB. 3D XPoint memory has better endurance than NAND flash, but not enough to get away without wear levelling. The fine-grained accessibility of 3D XPoint memory gets rid of a lot of the wear leveling and write amplification headaches caused by flash pages and erase blocks being larger than the sector sizes exposed by the drives, but the drive still needs some spare area plus storage for error correction overhead, metadata for tracking the mapping between logical blocks and physical addresses, and potential replacement of bad sectors, similar to normal SSDs.", "As with most NVMe SSDs, the Optane SSD DC P4800X supports a configurable sector size. Out of the box it emulates 512B sectors for the sake of compatibility, but using the NVMe FORMAT command it can be switched to emulate 4kB sectors. The larger sector size reduces the amount of metadata the SSD controller has to juggle, so it usually allows for slightly higher performance. The NVMe FORMAT command is also the mechanism for triggering a secure erase of the entire drive, and for flash SSDs the format usually consists of little more than issuing block erase commands to the whole drive. 3D XPoint memory does not have large multi-megabyte erase blocks, so a low-level format of the Optane SSD needs to directly write to the entire drive, which takes about as long as filling it sequentially. Thus, while a 2.4TB flash SSD can perform a low-level format in just over 13 seconds, the 375GB Optane SSD DC P4800X takes six minutes and 47 seconds. ", "So far, Intel has only started shipping the 375GB Optane SSD DC P4800X to select customers, and they have not released detailed specifications for the larger capacities that will ship later this year.", "It is worth noting that the performance specifications for the P4800X, as provided in the product specification sheets, cover a different set of metrics than Intel usually reports for their enterprise SSDs. Sequential performance is not mentioned at all, but the product brief has quite a bit to say about latency: average latency for QD1 reads and writes, and 99.999th percentile latency for both reads and writes at QD1 and QD16. The fact that Intel is publishing a five-nines QoS metric at all suggests that they plan to set a new standard for performance consistency.", "The throughput claims are also remarkable: half a million IOPS or more for reads, writes and a 70/30 read/write mix. There are already drives on the market that can deliver more than 550k random read IOPS, but those SSDs are far larger than 375GB and they require very high queue depths to hit 550k IOPS. There are even a few multi-TB drives that can beat 500k random write IOPS, but they can't sustain that performance indefinitely. The Optane SSD DC P4800X is promising an unprecedented level of storage performance both in absolute terms and relative to its capacity, so it is interesting to see where Intel is going to lay down its line in the sand.", "niche", "One of the unique and most notable performance advantages of the Optane SSD DC P4800X is that it does not require extremely high queue depths to reach full throughput. Enterprise customers have long had to design their systems around the fact that getting full performance out of the fastest PCIe SSDs requires loading them down with queue depths of 128 or higher, sometimes requiring applications to use dozens of threads for I/O. In the client space achieving such queue depths is outright impossible, and in the enterprise space it doesn't happen for free. The P4800X's high performance at low queue depths makes it a much easier drive to get great real-world performance out of.", "Intel originally introduced 3D XPoint memory as having far higher write endurance than NAND flash—on the order of 1000x higher. The Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for 30 drive writes per day (DWPD) for five years, and the current models shipping during this early limited availability period are only rated for three years, rather than the five years it expects the support for the full retail models. Intel says they're being extremely conservative with a new and unproven technology, and doing the math means that 30 DWPD doesn't provide any endurance advantage over the most highly over-provisioned flash-based enterprise SSDs. In terms of total petabytes written, the P4800X only has four-fifths the endurance of the SLC-based Micron P320h. Even allowing for Intel's original comparisons possibly having been relative to lower-endurance contemporary MLC or TLC flash, it seems like this first generation of 3D XPoint memory is not as durable as originally planned - the headline number of 30 DWPD is aimed at alleviating that issue, however for Intel to match its original intentions then the second and third generation parts will have to be a step up, and we look forward to testing them.", "The MSRP for the 375GB P4800X is $1520, though it will be quite some time before it can readily be ordered from major online retailers. At slightly more than $4/GB, the P4800X will be almost twice as expensive per GB as Intel's next most pricey SSD, the P3608 (which is really two drives in one plus a PCIe switch). Compared to Intel's fastest single SSD (the P3700), the P4800X will be more than three times as expensive per GB. In the broader SSD market, $4/GB is not completely unprecedented, but most companies selling drives in this price range don't even pretend to have a retail price.", "For this review of the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, first, we are going to take a deeper dive into what 3D XPoint actually is. Then we go through our testing suite for enterprise drives, testing Intel's claims on performance."]},

As expected, the company intends to start volume production of new types of memory and expand production capacities. What is noteworthy is that the company will primarily invest in the expansion of NAND flash manufacturing capacities, rather than the expansion of DRAM production, in the short-term future.", "SK Hynix began to make DRAM using its 21 nm fabrication process in late 2015. The manufacturer has been gradually expanding usage of the technology as well as improving its yields since then. By now, SK Hynix makes a wide range of its products (including mainstream DRAM, mobile DRAM and specialized memory) using its 21 nm manufacturing process. This week the company confirmed that it intends to start volume production of DRAM using its 10 nm-class process technology (which industry experts believe is 18 nm) this year.", "Just like other memory makers, SK Hynix plans to be conservative about its DRAM capital expenditures in 2017 and at present the company does not plan to undertake any significant capacity expansions. In the meantime, further increase of DRAM production using the 21 nm fabrication process and the start of 18 nm DRAM volume ramp in the second half of 2017 will automatically boost SK Hynix’s DRAM bit output — as memory cells get smaller, it is possible to produce more bits using one 300 mm wafer.", "Meanwhile, analysts from ", " believe that DRAM bit demand in 2017 will surpass 20% year-over-year, whereas DRAM bit supply by various makers will increase by around 19% YoY. The imbalance between demand and supply is projected to create shortages of DRAM as well as keep prices at high levels. Apart from PCs, there are two more factors that are going to raise demand for memory: first, Intel’s upcoming Xeon platform 'Purley' is expected to drive demand; and second, higher-end Google Android-based smartphones are expected to receive a memory upgrade with top-of-the-range models holding 8 GB of LPDDR4/LPDDR4X.", "Demand for NAND flash has been steadily increasing in the recent years because the industry is increasing output of NAND-based devices (e.g., smartphones, SSDs, consumer electronics, etc.) as well as its content per box (e.g., the entry-level Apple iPhone 7 now contains 32 GB of storage, up from 16 GB). To meet the growing demand, manufacturers expand production capacities and introduce higher-capacity 3D NAND memory chips. Just like its competitors, SK Hynix plans to boost production of NAND in general and launch new ICs.", "SK Hynix started to mass-produce its 36-layer 128 Gb 3D MLC NAND (which it calls 3D-V2) chips in 2015 and these ICs have been primarily used for various removable storage products. Last year, the company also started to make 48-layer 3D NAND (3D-V3) ICs that are to be used for various types of memory cards, flash drives, embedded storage and SSDs. With its third-gen 3D NAND, SK Hynix focuses on 256 Gb (32 GB) TLC ICs. The latter are used to build various NAND packages with 256 Gb, 512 Gb, 1024 Gb, 2048 Gb and even 4096 Gb capacities, which can be used for a variety of applications.", "Later this year SK Hynix intends to start volume production of 72-layer 3D TLC NAND (3D-V4) memory and this is where things start to get interesting. Initially, SK Hynix intends to produce 256 Gb 3D TLC ICs and these are going to be available already in Q2 2017, according to the company’s product catalog. Later on, sometimes in Q4, the company plans to introduce 512 Gb 3D TLC ICs (64 GB), which will help it to significantly increase capacities of SSDs and other devices featuring NAND flash. What is important about SK Hynix’s fourth-gen 3D NAND is that it will feature block size of 13.5 MB, which will increase the performance of such ICs compared to 3D-V3 and 3D-V2 that have a block size of 9 MB. At this point, we do not know whether SK Hynix intends to increase interface speed of its 512 Gb 3D-V4 ICs to compensate lower parallelism in lower-capacity SSDs, like Samsung did with its high-capacity 64-layer 3D V-NAND chips. What we do know is that SK Hynix’s catalog already includes NAND multi-chip packages of 8192 Gb capacity (1 TB) that will enable high-capacity SSDs in smaller form-factors (e.g., 2 GB single-sided M.2). Meanwhile, 64 GB NAND flash chips may force SK Hynix and its partners to abandon low-capacity SSDs (i.e., 120/128 GB) unless there is sufficient demand.", "As reported earlier, SK Hynix also plans to start using the upper floor of its M14 facility to produce NAND memory this year. The company this week confirmed the plan, but revealed no specifics.", "In any case, as the manufacturer continues to ramp up the M14 fab and its NAND flash output is increasing. Since SK Hynix is also gradually switching to 256 Gb (and 512 Gb starting from Q4), its NAND bit output is also gradually growing, which enables it to sell higher-capacity storage solutions.", "SK Hynix also plans to start cleanroom expansion of the C2 fab in Wuxi, China, which will cost the company around $790 million and will take nearly two years. The C2 manufacturing facility is used to make DRAM and since manufacturing technologies involve more complex and lengthening production cycles, the cleanroom expansion will enable SK Hynix to maintain the current output of the C2 into the future. Keep in mind that the work is expected to be finished in April 2019, so do not expect the expansion to have any short-term effects on memory prices.", "Related Reading:"]},

Mushkin indicates that the drives can deliver up to 232K/185K 4KB read/write IOPS, which is well beyond capabilities of the SM2260 declared by Silicon Motion (120K/140K).

For the moment, Micron's 3D NAND is the only viable option for most SSD manufacturers looking to move beyond planar NAND. Samsung is keeping almost all of their 3D NAND for their own very successful SSDs. Toshiba and SK Hynix are technically shipping 3D NAND but in limited supply and the poor cost effectiveness have prevented any third parties from adopting it for commercial SSDs. Toshiba and SK Hynix each have at least one or two token models in the supply chain using their 3D NAND, but still no mass-market consumer or retail availability.

The Intel 600p is the most affordable NVMe SSD on the market and it offers real-world performance that exceeds any SATA SSD. That leaves plenty of room in the market for other models with 3D NAND, and plenty of interest from consumers seeking the benefits of 3D NAND.", "Micron's 32-layer 3D TLC NAND has a capacity of 384Gb (48GB) per die. This odd capacity means that while the SU800 has typical usable capacities like 128GB and 512GB, the die counts and raw flash capacities aren't powers of two. The 128GB SU800 has just three packages with one die each for a raw capacity of 144GiB. The 256GB and 512GB SU800s use three and six dual-die flash packages, respectively.

While no new products were announced at this investor-focused event, their projections offer some insight about what's in store for the memory industry in 2017 and beyond. With both NAND flash and DRAM in short supply globally, Micron's projections of increasing production volume and decreasing cost per bit are welcome reassurance.", "In 2016, Micron and Intel's joint venture became the second manufacturer to sell 3D NAND flash in volume. That 32-layer first generation 3D NAND has reached mature yields that are comparable to that of planar NAND processes, and since last fall 3D NAND has accounted for a growing majority of Micron's NAND output on a per-bit basis.", "In 2017 Micron will be ramping up production of their 64-layer second generation 3D NAND, which is currently sampling. They promise meaningful output by the end of their fiscal year (December 2017). The 64-layer 3D NAND will increase the total GB per wafer by more than 80% and decrease the cost per bit of TLC by at least 30%.", "With the second generation 3D NAND, Micron is shifting their strategy slightly by offering at least two different die sizes. We've previously heard about the 512Gb 64-layer 3D TLC part, but Micron will also be making a smaller 256Gb 3D TLC part. This die is planned to be the smallest 256Gb NAND flash die available from any vendor, at 59 mm^2 or 4.3Gb/mm^2. The smaller die is intended for the mobile market where the 512Gb part will be physically too large. Micron's market share for NAND in the mobile market has been quite low, in part because they tend toward making large, high-capacity chips. The new smaller part will give them a chance to go after a much larger share of the rapidly expanding mobile storage market. The smaller part may also see some use in the SSD market for the smallest models in each family, to avoid the pitfalls of having too few dies to stripe data accesses across.", "Micron is not ready to share many specifics of their third generation 3D NAND flash, but they plan to begin small scale manufacturing in the second half of 2017.

They are watching the demand quite closely and plan to be ready to introduce QLC NAND for certain cloud computing uses once the market is ready. (The very low write endurance of QLC NAND makes it necessary for software to be modified to minimize unnecessary writes, and QLC drives will generally not be suitable as drop-in replacement of 3D TLC NAND.)", "Last year, Micron ramped up production of their 20nm DRAM, and by the third quarter 20nm was a majority of Micron's DRAM output. In 2017, Micron will be ramping up and begin transitioning to their 1x nm (16nm) node for DRAM, improving cost per GB by at least 20%. They plan to introduce 16nm GDDR5 later this year. Development is underway for both their 1Y nm and 1Z nm DRAM nodes, with initial manufacturing of 1Y nm DRAM expected to begin in the second half of 2017. Overall, they estimate the 1Y nm node is about a year behind the 1X nm node. GDDR5X volume is expected to grow significantly to satisfy bandwidth-hungry uses involving GPUs and networking, and around the end of this year or early next year Micron plans to introduce GDDR6 memory.", "As usual, relatively little was said about 3D XPoint. Micron considers the memory to be commercially ready technology, with work underway on second and third generation 3D XPoint chips. The new generations will bring significant performance and density increases, but there are no numbers to back up those statements yet.", "No specific products have been announced under their QuantX brand for 3D XPoint, but Micron plans to have some early market adoption of 3D XPoint by the end of the year. Even once 3D XPoint-based NVDIMMs are available, Micron is not concerned that 3D XPoint will significantly cannibalize their DRAM or NAND business.", "Separate from 3D XPoint, Micron is working on at least one other new memory technology, as an in-house project instead of a collaboration with Intel. This new technology has not been named by Micron, but it will apparently allow for DRAM-like performance, which would be significantly higher than what 3D XPoint can deliver. This unspecified technology also has a clear potential for cost scaling, perhaps through increasing layering. The target it to be a bit slower and cheaper than DRAM, taking into account where DRAM technology is expected to be by the time this new memory comes to market. This is not at all an imminent revolution, and it could be a decade before it is mass produced and getting used in mainstream situations.", "As for long-term trends, Micron sees the memory market as a whole becoming less volatile as DRAM's boom and bust cycles get less severe and NAND flash with its steadier growth accounts for an ever increasing share of the memory market. Weathering periods of oversupply and their associated price crashes is trying for memory manufacturers, and usually requires significant cuts to capital expenditures, which can delay the introduction of new technologies.", "In spite of current shortages, Micron expects healthy growth in volume and decrease in cost per bit for both DRAM and NAND over the next few years. NAND flash sales are expected to grow faster than DRAM, so while DRAM is currently a larger part of Micron's business than NAND flash, that may change in a few years. Micron expects the memory market as a whole to grow at about 2.5 times the growth rate of the rest of the semiconductor industry.", "In general, Micron is not looking to become significantly more vertically integrated. In particular, they do not want to become a competitor to their valuable DRAM customers. However, Micron is pursuing innovations in packaging, and they want to significantly expand their market share for what they call heterogeneous multi-chip packaging (xMCP): putting DRAM, NAND and logic in one package, such as for mobile devices or BGA SSDs.", "Meanwhile it will surprise absolutely nobody to hear that Micron's deployment of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has experienced a setback. Last spring Micron reported that they planned to have their first EUV tool installed in their research fab by the end of the year. The equipment is in place but not online yet, so Micron does not yet have any preliminary results to report. Micron says nothing on their current roadmaps requires EUV, so at this point it is just a potential for cheaper or more efficient manufacturing, not a looming roadblock.", "Finally, after three decades with Micron and having spent the past five years as its CEO, Mark Durcan has announced his intention to retire as soon as the board of directors can hire a successor. Durcan had previously announced plans to retire in 2012 while serving as the company's president, but the death of then-CEO Steve Appleton prompted Durcan to postpone his retirement indefinitely to serve as Micron's CEO.

{"title": "Everspin Announces New MRAM Products And Partnerships", "paragraph": ["Magnetoresistive RAM manufacturer Everspin has announced their first MRAM-based storage products and issued two other press releases about recent accomplishments. Until now, Everspin's business model has been to sell discrete MRAM components, but they're introducing a NVMe SSD based on their MRAM. Everspin's MRAM is one of the highest-performing and most durable non-volatile memory technologies on the market today, but its density and capacity falls far short of NAND flash, 3D XPoint, and even DRAM. As a result, use of MRAM has largely been confined to embedded systems and industrial computing that need consistent performance and high reliability, but have very modest capacity requirements. MRAM has also seen some use as a non-volatile cache or configuration memory in some storage array controllers. The new nvNITRO family of MRAM drives is intended to be used as a storage accelerator: a high-IOPS low-latency write cache or transaction log, with performance exceeding that of any single-controller drive based on NAND flash.", "Everspin's current generation of spin-torque MRAM has a capacity of 256Mb per die with a DDR3 interface (albeit with very different timings from JEDEC standard for DRAM). The initial nvNITRO products will use 32 or 64 MRAM chips to offer capacities of 1GB or 2GB on a PCIe 3 x8 card. MRAM has high enough endurance that the nvNITRO does not need to perform any wear leveling, which allows for a drastically simpler controller design and means performance does not degrade over time or as the drive is filled up—the nvNITRO does not need any large spare area or overprovisioning. Read and write performance are also nearly identical, while flash memory suffers from much slower writes than reads, which forces flash-based SSDs to buffer and combine writes in order to offer good performance. Everspin did not have complete performance specifications available at time of writing, but the numbers they did offer are very impressive: 6µs overall latency for 4kB transfers (compared to 20µs for the ", "), and 1.5M IOPS (4kB) at QD32 (compared to 1.2M IOPS read/200k IOPS write for the ", "). The nvNITRO does rely somewhat on higher queue depths to deliver full performance, but it is still able to deliver over 1M IOPS at QD16, around 800k IOPS at QD8, and QD1 performance is around 175k IOPS read/150k IOPS write. MRAM supports fine-grained access, so the nvNITRO performs well even with small transfer sizes: Everspin has hit 2.2M IOPS for 512B transfers, although that is not an official performance specification or measurement from the final product.", "As part of today's announcements, Everspin is introducing MRAM support for Xilinx UltraScale FPGAs in the form of scripts for Xilinx's Memory Interface Generator tool. This will allow customers to integrate MRAM into their designs as easily as they would use SDRAM or SRAM. The nvNITRO drives are a demonstration of this capability, as the SSD controller is implemented on a Xilinx FPGA. The FPGA provides the PCIe upstream link as a standard feature, the memory controller is Everspin's new and Everspin has developed a custom NVMe implementation to take advantage of the low latency and simple management afforded by MRAM. Everspin claims a 30% performance advantage over an unspecified NVRAM drive based on battery-backed DRAM, and attributes it primarily to their lightweight NVMe protocol implementation. In addition to NVMe, the nvNITRO can be configured to allow all or part of the memory to be directly accessible for memory-mapped IO, bypassing the protocol overhead of NVMe.", " ", " ", "The initial version of the nvNITRO is built with an off-the-shelf FPGA development board and mounts the MRAM on a pair of SO-DIMMs. Later this year Everspin will introduce new denser versions on a custom PCIe card, as well as M.2 drives and 2.5 U.2 using a 15mm height to accommodate two stacked PCBs. By the end of the year, Everspin will be shipping their next generation 1Gb ST-MRAM with a DDR4 interface, and the nvNITRO will use that to expand to capacities of up to 16GB in the PCIe half-height half-length card form factor, 8GB in 2.5 U.2, and at least 512MB for M.2.", "Everspin has not announced pricing for the nvNITRO products. The first generation nvNITRO products are currently sampling to select customers and will be for sale in the second quarter of this year, primarily through storage vendors and system integrators as a pre-installed option.", "Everspin is also announcing another design win for their older field-switched MRAM technology. JAG Jakob Ltd is adopting Everspin's 16Mb MRAM parts for their PdiCS process control systems, with MRAM serving as both working memory and code storage. These systems have extremely strict uptime requirements, hard realtime performance requirements and service lifetimes of up to 20 years; there are very few memory technologies on the market that can satisfy all of those requirements. Everspin will continue to develop their line of MRAM devices that compete against SRAM and NOR flash even as their higher-capacity offerings adopt DRAM-like interfaces."]},

All four major NAND manufacturers plan to ship 64+ layer 3D NAND this year with TLC parts up to 512Gb, and if things go according to plan for at least two or three of them we should see the NAND shortage start to fade and prices and capacities improve.", "The WD Black comes in only the two capacities that should be most popular: 256GB and 512GB. A 128GB PCIe SSD risks squandering much of the advantage of the faster interface due to the low number of NAND dies being a bottleneck, and 1TB PCIe SSDs are still expensive enough to be substantially less popular. A 1TB version would also need to be a double-sided M.2 module, which would limit compatibility with some laptops. As expected for a TLC SSD, the rated read performance is much higher than the write performance, though Western Digital does still give the WD Black a very nice looking random write rating. The endurance ratings for the WD Black are a little lower than I'd like to see given that even a TLC-based PCIe SSD is something of a premium product, but the five year warranty is quite reasonable.", "Western Digital is currently taking pre-orders for the WD Black at MSRP and projecting a ship date of March 14, while there are already some third-party Amazon sellers offering it above MSRP.

The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is an enterprise PCIe 3 x4 NVMe SSD that Intel promises will be the the most responsive data center SSD with lower latency than all of the fastest NAND flash based competitors. After months of touting 3D XPoint memory primarily with rough order of magnitude claims about its performance, endurance and cost relative to DRAM and NAND flash, and after some unexplained delays, Intel is finally providing some concrete specifications and pricing for a complete SSD that is shipping today. The information is more limited than we're accustomed to for their NAND flash SSDs, and Intel still isn't confirming anything about the materials or exact operating principle of the 3D XPoint memory cell.", "Current computer system architectures are based around the use of DRAM as working memory and NAND flash for fast storage. 3D XPoint memory falls between the two technologies on most important metrics, so Optane SSDs bring a new dimension of complication to a server architect's task. For most enterprise use cases, the most enticing feature of Optane SSDs over NAND SSDs is the former's higher performance, especially reduced latencies. Aside from the gains from switching to the NVMe protocol, the latency offered by NAND flash based SSDs has been mostly stagnant or even regressed with the disappearance of SLC NAND from the market, even as throughput and capacity have grown with every generation.", "The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for a typical read or write latency under 10µs, compared to tens of microseconds for the best NAND flash based SSDs, and about 4µs minimum imposed by PCIe and NVMe transaction overhead. More impressive is how little latency degrades under less than ideal conditions. Queue depth 1 random reads are rated to remain below 30µs even while the drive is simultaneously accepting 2GB/s of sustained random writes (about 500k IOPS). Intel even specifies Quality of Service (QoS) standards for latency at the 99.999th percentile, with even QD16 random writes staying almost entirely below 200µs. A consequence of the low latency is that the P4800X can deliver full throughput at lower queue depths: the P4800X is rated to deliver maximum IOPS at QD16 while flash-based SSDs are specified for queue depths of at least 32. Unlike flash memory, the read and write performance of 3D XPoint memory is roughly equal, and this is reflected in Intel's specifications for the P4800X.", "Conspicuously missing from the performance specifications are sequential throughput. The P4800X can already use more than half of the available PCIe bandwidth with a completely random I/O workload. Rather than reassure us that the P4800X can do even better with larger transfer sizes, Intel suggests that being overly concerned with the sequential transfer speeds is a sign that you should be shopping for their 3D NAND SSDs instead. They'll offer plenty of throughput for a far lower price.", "Intel's 3D XPoint memory is being manufactured as a 128Gb (16GB) die, slightly behind the trend for NAND flash capacities. As a result, the Optane SSD DC P4800X will start with a 375GB model and later this year be followed by 750GB and 1.5TB models. The top-performing enterprise SSDs currently tend to be multi-TB drives. Intel has shared very few details about the new controller they've developed for the P4800X, but they have disclosed that the 375GB model uses seven channels with four dies per channel, for a total of 28 chips and a raw capacity of 448GB. Fourteen packages of 3D XPoint memory are visible on the back side of the drive in the photographs Intel has released, suggesting that fourteen more packages are hiding under the heatsink and that the 375GB add-in card model is using single-die packages. The controller implements a high-performance all-hardware read path that does not involve the drive's firmware, and while the exact stride of memory accesses is not known, a single 4k read will be spread across all seven channels.", "3D XPoint memory can be read or written with byte granularity and modifications can be written in place, so it is free from the worst internal fragmentation and write amplification challenges that are caused by the large page sizes and huge erase block sizes of NAND flash. This means that further overprovisioning beyond the drive's native amount will have minimal impact on performance and that the performance of a full drive should not suffer severely the way flash based SSDs do. However, some amount of spare area is still required for error correction and other metadata and for a pool of spare blocks to replace failed or defective blocks. The write endurance of 3D XPoint memory is not infinite so wear leveling is still required, but it is a much simpler process that requires much less spare area.", "The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X has a write endurance rating of 30 Drive Writes Per Day, and Intel is hopeful that future products can offer even higher ratings once 3D XPoint memory has more broadly proven its reliability. Today's limited release 375GB models have a three year warranty for a total write endurance rating of 12.3 PB, and once the product line is expanded to broad availability of the full range of capacities in the second half of this year the warranty period will be five years.", "Intel is offering the 375GB P4800X in PCIe add-in card form factor with a MSRP of $1520 starting today with a limited early-ship program. In Q2 a 375GB U.2 model will ship, as well as a 750GB add-in card. In the second half of the year the rest of the capacity and form factor options will be available, but prices and exact release dates for those models have not been announced. At just over $4/GB the P4800X seems to fall much closer to DRAM than NAND in price, though to be fair the enterprise SSDs it will compete against are all well over $1/GB and the largest DDR4 DIMMs are around $10/GB.", "Along with the DC P4800X, Intel is launching Intel Memory Drive Technology software as a paid add-on. The Memory Drive Technology software is a custom virtual memory system implemented as a minimal hypervisor. The guest operating system or general-purpose hypervisor is presented with the illusion that a portion of the 3D XPoint memory on the Optane SSD is directly addressable, producing an apparent memory capacity that far exceeds the capacity of the system's installed DRAM. Under the hood and almost entirely transparent to the guest OS, Intel Memory Drive Technology monitors memory access patterns to cache actively used data in DRAM and prefetch from Optane SSDs. At a high level, this is merely duplicating the paging mechanisms all operating systems already provide. However, Intel claims that the heuristics used by Memory Drive Technology can far outperform those currently used by operating systems to manage swap space residing on storage that is far slower than Optane SSDs. On some workloads Intel Memory Drive Technology can offer performance approaching that of an all-DRAM memory pool of equal capacity, though this will depend highly on the specific application workload.", "Intel Memory Drive Technology has a substantial capacity overhead: a 375GB Optane SSD can provide up to 320GB of virtual memory. Multiple Optane SSDs can be used to provide virtual memory up to ten times the system's DRAM capacity, though Intel recommends Optane to DRAM ratios between 3:1 and 8:1. When multiple CPUs or Optane SSDs are in use, the Memory Drive Technology software will take into account non-uniform memory access (NUMA) effects and attempt to optimize data placement to put data in the DRAM or Optane SSD that is closest to the core using it. By default, the Memory Drive Technology software will present to the guest OS a NUMA topology equivalent to the underlying DRAM configuration plus a pool of memory that is not local to any of the processors, with capacity equal to the virtual memory provided by the Optane SSDs. However, this is implemented purely for the sake of allowing NUMA-aware software to adapt its usage patterns; regardless of the NUMA configuration seen by the guest software, the Memory Drive Technology software will not be statically allocating specific address ranges to DRAM or Optane storage. The approach taken by the Memory Drive Technology software allows operating systems and applications to function without modification and without requiring Optane-specific optimizations, but it also means there is no way for applications that are NUMA-aware or use system calls like ", " to communicate directly with the real memory allocator.", "The full licensing cost structure for Intel Memory Drive Technology is not clear, but the MSRP for a 375GB P4800X bundled with Memory Drive Technology is $1951 compared to $1520 for the SSD alone.

This week, 3D XPoint memory comes to the client and consumer market in the form of the Intel Optane Memory product, a low-capacity M.2 NVMe SSD intended for use as a cache drive for systems using a mechanical hard drive for primary storage.", "The Intel Optane Memory SSD uses one or two single-die packages of 3D XPoint non-volatile memory to provide capacities of 16GB or 32GB. The controller gets away with a much smaller package than most SSDs (especially PCIe SSD) since it only supports two PCIe 3.0 lanes and does not have an external DRAM interface. Because only two PCIe lanes are used by the drive, it is keyed to support M.2 type B and M slots. This keying is usually used for M.2 SATA SSDs while M.2 PCIe SSDs typically use only the M key position to support four PCIe lanes. The Optane Memory SSD will not function in a M.2 slot that provides only SATA connectivity. Contrary to some early leaks, the Optane Memory SSD uses the M.2 2280 card size instead of one of the shorter lengths. This makes for one of the least-crowded M.2 PCBs on the market even with all of the components on the top side.", "The very low capacity of the Optane Memory drives limits their usability as traditional SSDs. Intel intends for the drive to be used with the caching capabilities of their Rapid Storage Technology drivers. Intel first introduced SSD caching with their ", " in 2011. The basics of Optane Memory caching are mostly the same, but under the hood Intel has tweaked the caching algorithms to better suit 3D XPoint memory's performance and flexibility advantages over flash memory. Optane Memory caching is currently only supported on Windows 10 64-bit and only for the boot volume. Booting from a cached volume requires that the chipset's storage controller be in RAID mode rather than AHCI mode so that the cache drive will not be accessible as a standard NVMe drive and is instead remapped to only be accessible to Intel's drivers through the storage controller. This NVMe remapping feature was first added to the Skylake-generation 100-series chipsets, but boot firmware support will only be found on Kaby Lake-generation 200-series motherboards and Intel's drivers are expected to only permit Optane Memory caching with Kaby Lake processors.", "Intel has published some specifications for the Optane Memory drive's performance on its own. The performance specifications are the same for both capacities, suggesting that the controller has only a single channel interface to the 3D XPoint memory. The read performance is extremely good given the limitation of only one or two memory devices for the controller to work with, but the write throughput is quite limited. Read and write latency are very good thanks to the inherent performance advantage of 3D XPoint memory over flash. Endurance is rated at just 100GB of writes per day, for both 16GB and 32GB models. While this does correspond to 3-6 DWPD and is far higher than consumer-grade flash based SSDs, 3D XPoint memory was supposed to have vastly higher write endurance than flash and neither of the Optane products announced so far is specified for game-changing endurance. Power consumption is rated at 3.5W during active use, so heat shouldn't be a problem, but the idle power of 0.9-1.2W is a bit high for laptop use, especially given that there will also be a hard drive drawing power.", "Intel's vision is for Optane Memory-equipped systems to offer a compelling performance advantage over hard drive-only systems for a price well below an all-flash configuration of equal capacity. The 16GB Optane Memory drive will retail for $44 while the 32GB version will be $77. As flash memory has declined in price over the years, it has gotten much easier to purchase SSDs that are large enough for ordinary use: 256GB-class SSDs start at around the same price as the 32GB Optane Memory drive, and 512GB-class drives are about the same as the combination of a 2TB hard drive and the 32GB Optane Memory. The Optane Memory products are squeezing into a relatively small niche for limited budgets that require a lot of storage and want the benefit of solid state performance without paying the full price of a boot SSD. Intel notes that Optane Memory caching can be used in front of hybrid drives and SATA SSDs, but the performance benefit will be smaller and these configurations are not expected to be common or cost effective.", "The Optane Memory SSDs are now available for pre-order and are scheduled to ship on April 24. Pre-built systems equipped with Optane Memory should be available around the same time. Enthusiasts with large budgets will want to wait until later this year for Optane SSDs with sufficient capacity to use as primary storage.

Formally, the PS3111-S11 is positioned below the S10 because it has only two NAND channels with 16 CE targets and physically cannot deliver breakthrough performance. As it is a SATA controller, the PS3111-S11 does not have to deliver anything sequentially higher than 550 MB/s and this is something it can do with both MLC and TLC chips (sustained performance is a different comparison). The most important advancement of the controller versus its predecessors is that the PS3111-S11 supports LDPC ECC, and thus can be enabled on SSDs with sufficient endurance. Additionally, the PS3111-S11 supports 3D and 1z MLC/TLC NAND flash and memory with large (8 KB and 16 KB) blocks.", "As for the drives, the Palit UVS family will include 120 GB, 256 GB, 480 GB and 512 GB models using 3D TLC NAND (except the 120GB, which is planar TLC).

Today Intel launches the first consumer product under the Optane brand: the Intel Optane Memory, a far smaller device with a price that is 20 times cheaper. Despite having Memory in its name, this consumer Optane Memory product is not a NVDIMM nor is it in any other way a replacement for DRAM (those products will be coming to the enterprise market next year, even though the obvious name is now taken). Optane Memory also not a suitable replacement for mainstream flash-based SSDs, because Optane Memory is only available in 16GB and 32GB capacities. Instead, Optane Memory is Intel's latest attempt at an old idea that is great in theory but has struggled to catch on in practice: SSD caching.", "Optane is Intel's brand name for products based on the ", ". 3D XPoint is a new class of non-volatile memory that is not a variant of flash memory, the current mainstream technology for solid state drives. NAND flash memory—be it older planar NAND or newer 3D NAND flash—has fundamental limits to performance and write endurance, and many of the problems get worse as flash is shrunk to higher densities. 3D XPoint memory takes a radically different approach to non-volatile storage, and it makes different tradeoffs between density, performance, endurance and cost. Intel's initial announcement of 3D XPoint memory technology in 2015 came with general order of magnitude comparisons against existing memory technologies (DRAM and flash). Compared to NAND flash, 3D XPoint is supposed to be on the order of 1000x faster with 1000x higher write endurance. Compared to DRAM, 3D XPoint memory is supposed to be about 10x denser, which generally implies it'll be cheaper per GB by about the same amount. Those comparisons were about the raw memory itself and not about the performance of an entire SSD, and they were also projections based on memory that was still more than a year from hitting the market.", "3D XPoint memory is not intended or expected to be a complete replacement for flash memory or DRAM in the foreseeable future. It offers substantially lower latency than flash memory but at a much higher price per GB. It still has finite endurance that makes it unsuitable as a drop-in replacement for DRAM without some form of wear-leveling. The natural role for 3D XPoint technology seems to be as a new tier in the memory hierarchy, slotting in between the smaller but faster DRAM and the larger but slower NAND flash. The Optane products released this month are using the first-generation 3D XPoint memory, along with first-generation controllers. Future generations should be able to offer substantial improvements to performance, endurance and capacity, but it's too soon to tell how those characteristics will scale.", "The Intel Optane Memory is a M.2 NVMe SSD using 3D XPoint memory instead of NAND flash memory. 3D XPoint allows the Optane Memory to deliver far higher throughput than any flash SSD of equivalent capacity, and lower read latency than a NAND flash SSD of any capacity. The Optane Memory is intended both for OEMs to integrate into new systems and as an aftermarket upgrade for Optane Memory ready systems: those that meet the system requirements for Intel's new Optane caching software and have motherboard firmware support for booting from a cached volume. However, the Optane Memory can also be treated as a small and fast NVMe SSD, because all of the work to enable its caching role is performed in software or by the PCH on the motherboard. 32GB is even (barely) enough to be used as a Windows boot drive, though doing so would not be useful for most consumers.", "Intel Optane Memory uses a PCIe 3.0 x2 link, while most M.2 PCIe SSDs use the full 4 lanes the connector is capable of. The two-lane link allows the Optane Memory to use the same B and M connector key positions that are used by M.2 SATA SSDs, so there's no immediate visual giveaway that Optane Memory requires PCIe connectivity from the M.2 socket. The Optane Memory is a standard 22x80mm single-sided card but the components don't come close to using the full length. The controller chip is far smaller than a typical NVMe SSD controller, and the Optane Memory includes just one or two single-die packages of 3D XPoint memory. The Optane Memory module has labels on the front and back that contain a copper foil heatspreader layer, positioned to cool the memory rather than the controller. There is no DRAM visible on the drive.", "The performance specifications of Intel Optane Memory have been revised slightly since the ", ", with Intel now providing separate performance specs for the two capacities. Given the PCIe x2 link it's no surprise to see that sequential read speeds are substantially lower than we see from other NVMe SSDs, with 900 MB/s for the 16GB model and 1350 MB/s for the 32GB model. Sequential writes of 145 MB/s and 290 MB/s are far slower than consumer SSDs are usually willing to advertise, but are typical of the actual sustained sequential write speed of a good TLC NAND SSD. Random read throughput of 190k and 240k IOPS is in the ballpark for other NVMe SSDs. Random write throughput of 35k and 65k IOPS are also below the peak speeds advertised my most consumer SSDs, but on par with mainstream TLC and MLC SSDs respectively for actual performance at low queue depths.", "Really it's the latency specifications where Optane Memory shines: the read latency of 7µs and 9µs for the 16GB and 32GB respectively are slightly better than even the enterprise Optane SSD DC P4800x, while write latency of 18µs and 30µs are just 2-3 times slower. The read latencies are completely untouchable for flash-based SSDs, but the write latencies can be matched by other NVMe controllers, but only because they cache write operations instead of performing them immediately.", "The power consumption and endurance specifications don't look as impressive. 3.5W active power is lower than many M.2 PCIe SSDs and low enough that thermal throttling is unlikely to be a problem. The 1W idle power is unappealing, if not a bit problematic. Many M.2 NVMe SSDs will idle at 1W or more if the system is not using PCIe Active State Power Management and NVMe Power States. The Optane Memory doesn't even support the latter and will apparently draw the full 1W even in a well-tuned laptop. Since these power consumption numbers are typically going to be in addition to the power consumption of a mechanical hard drive, an Optane caching configuration is not going to offer decent power efficiency.", "Meanwhile write endurance is rated at the same 100GB/day or 182.5 TB total for both capacities. Even though a stress test could burn through all of that in a week or two, 100GB/day is usually plenty for ordinary consumer use. However, a cache drive will likely experience a higher than normal write load as data and applications will tend to get evicted from the cache only to be pulled back in the next time they are loaded. More importantly, Intel promised that 3D XPoint would have on the order of 1000x the endurance of NAND flash, which should put these drives beyond the write endurance of any other consumer SSDs even after accounting for their small capacity."]},

At the Dell EMC World conference, Toshiba has a live demo of a laptop containing a prototype XG-series NVMe PCIe SSD with a total of 1TB of BiCS3 3D TLC NAND. Toshiba's XG3 series is the OEM counterpart to the ", " consumer NVMe drives. Toshiba won't comment on how the XG prototype differs from the RD400 or XG3 aside from using 3D NAND, but the prototype probably offers an early look at what the next XG will feature when it is ready to be officially announced. The prototype is a model that is currently sampling to large OEMs and could be formally announced in just a few months.", "Toshiba has announced that they intend to migrate all of their SSD product lines to their 3D TLC NAND, starting with OEM and enterprise products before rolling out to the retail market. They are not willing to commit to a particular timeline for completing the transition, but we should see multiple models announced and shipping by the end of 2017. Supply will continue to be a concern as new 3D NAND fab capacity comes online in 2018, and that's when we might see the current flash memory shortage wrap up and SSD prices resume a healthy decline."]},
{"title": "Previewing Maxiotek's MK8115 SSD Controller: Can DRAM-less Drives Make The Cut?", "paragraph": ["Maxiotek is a very new name in the SSD market, but there's a long history behind the company. Last year, JMicron spun off their SSD controller business into Maxiotek, and the new company has retained the same engineering team and roadmap. Their first new SSD controller since being spun off is the Maxiotek MK8115, and recently we've finished testing on 512GB engineering samples that use it with both Micron 3D MLC and TLC.", "JMicron was one of the oldest players in the SSD market. When MLC SSDs first started to become affordable enough for some consumers, the JMicron JMF602 controller dominated the market, usually paired with Samsung MLC NAND flash. JMicron's turnkey solution was the starting point for many memory companies' entry into the SSD market. However, JMicron's fortunes changed when Intel got into the game with the X25-M and set a new standard for SSD performance. The X25-M put the JMF602 to shame and JMicron's reputation and market share have never fully recovered. JMicron's controllers matured along with the rest of the SSD market, but they've never been ahead of the curve and have largely been relegated to competing at the low end of the market.", "The JMicron SSD controller roadmap largely survived the transition to Maxiotek's independence, but everything got renamed and a few plans were changed. A few existing JMicron controllers are still for sale under their existing names, but even the flagship JMF670H is quite outdated, with a limit of 512GB capacity and no support for TLC NAND.", ". The MK8115 was originally planned to be an entry level solution, but for now it serves as the replacement for all the remaining JMicron SSD controllers. MK8115 is a big step forward: it increases the maximum drive capacity to 1TB, it adds support for 3D MLC and TLC, SLC caching, TCG OPAL encryption, and more robust error correction.", "The MK8115 controller does not use an external DRAM cache. DRAM-less controllers allow for a lower total bill of materials and a simpler and more compact PCB layout, but at the cost of lower performance. Mainstream SSD controllers typically use 1GB of DRAM for every 1TB of flash; this DRAM is not used to store user data that is in flight but to cache the metadata about where each logical block address is physically stored on the flash memory. Due to the wear leveling flash SSDs require, this information is constantly shifting with every write and it must be consulted for every read operation.", "Meanwhile also on Maxiotek's roadmap and due to hit the market this year is the MK8113 controller. Based on the same die as the MK8115, MK8113 will use a larger BGA package to enable an external DRAM interface with support for up to 2GB of DRAM and thus 2TB of flash. A successor generation consisting of MK8213 and MK8215 will further improve the error correction capabilities with codes comparable to LDPC, allowing cheap planar TLC to be supported with acceptable write endurance. The MK821x controllers are expected to be used mainly in ultra low-cost SSDs that are unlikely to be sold in the North American market, which is increasingly using 3D NAND that Maxiotek feels does not require the higher-overhead error correction.", "Maxiotex also has PCIe SSD controllers in the works, again in pairs with and without external DRAM support. MK8112 (DRAM-less) and MK8111 will use PCIe 3 x2 and AHCI instead of NVMe, so they will have a tough time catching on unless they are no more expensive than SATA. A later MK83xx generation will switch to NVMe and add support for the Host Memory Buffer feature that alleviates the worst limitations of DRAM-less SSD controllers. However Maxiotek hasn't given any target dates for controllers other than the current MK8115 and MK8113.", "The two MK8115 engineering samples we tested used different revisions of the PCB layout and different firmware versions, but the general design is similar. The controller and four NAND packages are the only large components on the top side, and there's plenty of empty space. The back side has a handful of smaller components and empty pads for four more NAND packages as well as for the power loss protection capacitors enterprise and industrial models would require. The 512GB drive with 3D MLC is using four 32GB dies per package while the TLC drive is using three 48GB dies per package for a much larger overprovisioning ratio.", "Maxiotek's first design win for the MK8115 was recently released: ", ". The SU700 pairs the MK8115 controller with Micron 3D TLC NAND, and is positioned just below the SU800 (Micron 3D TLC with Silicon Motion SM2258 controller) as ADATA's new entry-level 3D NAND SSD. The SU700 is also using higher levels of overprovisioning than our engineering samples of MK8115; whereas our samples are 512GB, ADATA ships its equivalent SU700 with an end-user capacity of 480GB, while the other SU700 capacities are 120, 240, and 960GB.", "The MK8115 is the first SSD controller from Maxiotek to ship, but the last generation of JMicron SSDs are an interesting point of comparison as they are effectively the ancestors of this new controller. We have results for both the ADATA XPG SX930 and an earlier engineering sample of the same JMF670H controller. Both of those drives used planar MLC NAND.", "We have not yet tested any other SATA SSDs using Micron's 3D MLC NAND (only ADATA has started shipping such a drive), so we're including the results for a PCIe SSD that uses Micron 3D MLC. That drive was an engineering sample of the Silicon Motion SM2260 platform, which is now retailing as the ADATA XPG SX8000.", "Micron's 3D TLC has seen wider adoption and is used in the Crucial MX300 and ADATA Ultimate SU800. Intel's version of the same 3D TLC design is used in the Intel SSD 600p, one of the cheapest PCIe SSDs on the market. These drives offer the best comparisons of how the MK8115 stacks up against other controller designs from Marvell and Silicon Motion.", "We have not tested many DRAM-less SSDs in recent years. The Phison S11, Marvell 88NV1120 and Silicon Motion SM2258XT are the primary competitors at the moment, but we have not yet tested drives using any of those controllers. The OCZ VX500 used Toshiba 15nm MLC with a controller that supports external DRAM, but only the 1TB model was populated with extra DRAM, and only 256MB. It's possible that the 512GB VX500 has some DRAM built-in to the controller package."]},

This requires extremely high precision when placing one wafer atop of each other. In addition, use of the string stacking technology requires Toshiba and Western Digital to process two wafers (with over 32 layers each) to assemble one wafer with 64 active layers of NAND. Keep in mind though that Toshibas has not confirmed string stacking process.", "By contrast, to make its 64-layer 3D NAND ICs, Samsung decided to make the structure of its 3D flash memory ICs thinner by making wordline layers (as well as the dielectrics between them) thinner. The move naturally increases the electrical resistance of the wordlines and degrades their retention, which required Samsung to introduce a set of technologies that mitigate the effects of thinner wordlines and dielectrics. The advantage of this approach is that Samsung only has to process one wafer, albeit using a complex process technology.", "Western Digital and Toshiba naturally do not disclose costs of their 512 Gb 3D TLC NAND, but WD claims that it has achieved a bit cost crossover for its 64-layer 3D NAND compared to its 128 Gb 2D TLC NAND made using the 15 nm process technology. This means that it is cheaper to build one 512 Gb 3D TLC chip than it is to build four 128 Gb 2D TLC chips, which is not exactly surprising.

Toshiba has been suffering financially due to crippling losses incurred by its nuclear power division, and to offset those losses Toshiba has been working to sell off its memory business. Toshiba's memory business is one of the most successful parts of the company and the Toshiba-SanDisk flash memory joint venture is one of the four major manufacturers of NAND flash memory.", "When Toshiba announced in March their intentions to raise cash by selling a stake in their memory business, a bidding war emerged. Western Digital, Micron and SK Hynix all sought to expand their share of the NAND flash market, but Toshiba was reluctant to sell to a competitor, hoping to avoid a prolonged anti-trust regulatory approval process. The Japanese government also does not want to see the NAND flash business sold to a Chinese-controlled company. This left private equity firms as the bidders Toshiba was most receptive to, but other technology companies like Broadcom and Foxconn are bidding.", "After failing to meet their goal of selling a 20% stake by the end of March, and as revised estimates made it clear that 20% would not cover Toshiba's nuclear losses, Toshiba's plans shifted toward a complete spin-off and sale of their Toshiba Memory division. As of February, Toshiba valued this unit at around $18B. In late March it was reported that Broadcom and Silver Lake Partners had jointly bid to buy Toshiba Memory for about that amount, then in early April Foxconn reportedly offered $27B. Broadcom has since increased their bid to $28B. SK Hynix and Bain Capital are reported to be jointly bidding up to $13.5B for a majority stake in Toshiba Memory.", "The bids for Toshiba Memory have reached prices that are difficult but not necessarily impossible for Western Digital to match. Western Digital would need to fund an acquisition with significant debt, and other analysts have speculated that it may be better for Western Digital to pursue acquiring a majority stake in Toshiba Memory rather than a complete acquisition.", "Western Digital does have leverage in their preexisting relationship with Toshiba as co-owner of their flash memory joint venture. Western Digital is alleging that Toshiba is required to obtain Western Digital's consent before spinning off or selling Toshiba Memory, and that Toshiba's actions so far have violated their agreements with Western Digital. Western Digital has initiated arbitration proceedings against Toshiba, seeking to block further action without Western Digital's consent and to reverse the Toshiba Memory spin-off.", "These arbitration proceedings are undoubtedly a major frustration to Toshiba, who badly want to close a deal two months ago. Instead, they are now faced with complicated litigation over the terms of at least three joint venture agreements with SanDisk that are now controlled by Western Digital. So far, Toshiba does not appear to have responded to the arbitration demand and Western Digital claims that Toshiba has indicated they have no intention to obtain consent before selling Toshiba Memory to the highest bidder. It is not clear how long this dispute could take to settle, but there is an initial 30-day window for Toshiba to respond before the conflict escalates. If Toshiba does agree to Western Digital's arbitration request, estimates range from six months to two years for that process to resolve.", "By stalling or blocking competing bids, Western Digital seems to be running out the clock on Toshiba with the goal of forcing them to accept a bid from Western Digital that would not be able to win in an open auction. The longer Western Digital can prevent Toshiba from closing a deal, the more desperate Toshiba will get to raise enough cash to keep the company as a whole afloat. Western Digital has not said whether they will file for an injunction if Toshiba does not agree to participate in arbitration, so there is still a lot of uncertainty about how severe this dispute will get and how long it will last. Analysts at J.P. Morgan are optimistic about Western Digital's prospects in this dispute and are among several analysts to have upgraded their ratings of Western Digital in recent months.", "Despite the dispute over corporate ownership rights, the day to day operations of the Toshiba/Western Digital NAND joint venture have been largely unaffected.

Western Digital predicts that 40% of their wafer output this year will be 3D NAND and 75% of that will be the 64-layer generation. Due to the ongoing industry-wide NAND flash shortage, all of the NAND produced by Toshiba and Western Digital is quite profitable and the companies are being judicious in allocating supply to the most lucrative market segments.

{"title": "NVMe 1.3 Specification Published With New Features For Client And Enterprise SSDs", "paragraph": ["The first major update to the NVMe storage interface specification in almost two and a half years has been published, standardizing many new features and helping set the course for the SSD market. Version 1.2 of the NVMe specification was ratified in November 2014 and since then there have been numerous corrections and clarifications but the only significant new feature added were the enterprise-oriented NVMe over Fabrics and NVMe Management Interface specifications. The NVMe 1.3 specification ratified last month and published earlier this month brings many new features for both client and server use cases. As with previous updates to the standard, most of the new features are optional but will probably see widespread adoption in their relevant market segments over the next few years. Several of the new NVMe features are based on existing features of other storage interfaces and protocol such as eMMC and ATA. Here are some of the most interesting new features:", "Much like the SMART self-test capabilities found on ATA drives, NVMe now defines an optional interface for the host system to instruct the drive to perform a self test. The details of what is tested are left up to the drive vendor, but drives should implement both short (no more than two minutes) and extended self tests that may include reading and writing to all or part of the storage media but must preserve user data and the drive must remain operational during the test (either by performing the test in the background or by pausing the test to service other IO requests). For the extended test, drives must offer an estimate of how long the test will take and provide a progress indicator during the test.", "Borrowing a feature from eMMC, NVMe 1.3 introduces support for boot partitions that can be accessed using a minimal subset of the NVMe protocol, without requiring the host to allocate and configure the admin or command queues. Boot Partitions are intended to reduce or eliminate the need for the host system to include another storage device such as a SPI flash to store the boot firmware (such as a UEFI implementation). Drives implementing the Boot Partition feature will include a pair of boot partitions to allow for safe firmware updates that write to the secondary partition and verify the data before swapping which partition is active.", "The boot partition feature is unlikely to be useful or ever implemented on user-upgradable drives, but it provides an opportunity for cost savings in embedded systems like smartphones and tablets, which are increasingly turning to NVMe BGA SSDs for high-performance storage. The boot partitions can also be made tamper resistant using the Replay Protected Memory Block feature that was introduced in NVMe 1.2.  ", "The new optional Sanitize feature set is another import from other storage standards; it is already available for SATA and SAS drives. The Sanitize command is an alternative to existing secure erase capabilities that makes stronger guarantees about data security by ensuring that user data is not only removed from the drive's media but from all of its caches, and the Controller Memory Buffer (if supported) is also wiped. The Sanitize command also lets the host be more explicit in specifying how the data is destroyed: through block erase operations, overwriting, or destroying the encryption key. (Drives may not support all three methods.) Current NVMe SSDs offer secure erase functionality through the Format NVM command, which exists primarily to support switching the block format from eg. 512 byte sectors to 4kB sectors, but can also optionally perform a secure erase in the process. While the Format NVM command's scope can be restricted to a particular namespace attached to the NVMe controller, the Sanitize command is always global and wipes the entire drive (save for boot partitions and the replay protected memory block, if implemented).", "Previous versions of the NVMe specification allowed for controllers to support virtualization through Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) but left the implementation details unspecified. Version 1.3 introduces a standard virtualization feature set that defines how SR-IOV capabilities can be configured and used. NVMe SSDs supporting the new virtualization enhancements will expose a primary controller as a SR-IOV physical function and one or more secondary controllers as SR-IOV virtual functions that can be assigned to virtual machines. (Strictly speaking, drives could implement the NVMe virtualization enhancements without supporting SR-IOV, but this is unlikely to happen.) The SSDs will have a pool of flexible resources (completion queues, submission queues and MSI-X interrupt vectors) that can be allocated to the drive's primary or secondary controllers.", "The NVMe virtualization enhancements greatly expand the usefulness of the existing NVMe namespace management features. So far, drives supporting multiple namespaces have been quite rare so the namespace features have mostly applied to multipath and NVMe over Fabrics use cases. Now, a single drive can use multiple namespaces to partition its storage among several virtual controllers assigned to different VMs, with the potential for namespaces to be exclusive or shared among VMs, all without requiring any changes to the NVMe drivers in the guest operating systems and without requiring the hypervisor to implement its own volume management layer.", "NVMe allows SSDs to support multiple sector sizes through the Format NVM command. Most SSDs default to 512-byte logical blocks but also support 4kB logical blocks, often with better performance. However, for flash-based SSDs, neither common sector size reflects the real page or block sizes of the underlying flash memory. Nobody is particularly interested in switching to the 16kB or larger sector sizes that would be necessary to match page sizes of modern 3D NAND flash, but there is potential for better performance if operating systems align I/O to the real page size. NVMe 1.3 introduces a Namespace Optimal IO Boundary field that provides exactly this performance hint to the host system, expressed as a multiple of the sector size (eg. 512B or 4kB).", "The new feature that may prove to have the biggest long-term impact is NVMe's Directives support, a generic framework for the controller and host system to exchange extra metadata in the headers of ordinary NVMe commands. For now, the only type of directive supported for ordinary IO commands is the Streams directive. Defined only for write commands, the streams directive allows the host to tag operations as related, such as originating from the same process or virtual machine. This serves as a hint to the controller about how to store that data on a physical level. For example, if multiple streams are actively writing simultaneously, the controller would probably want to write data from each stream contiguously rather than interleave writes from multiple streams into writes to the same physical page erase block. This can lead to more consistent write performance for multithreaded workloads, better prefetching for reads, and lower write amplification.", "NVMe power management is far more flexible than what SATA drives support. NVMe drives can declare several different power states including multiple operational and non-operational idle states. The drive can provide the host with information about the maximum power draw in each state, the latency to enter and leave each state, and the relative performance of the various operational power states. For drives supporting the optional Autonomous Power State Transitions feature (APST) introduced in NVMe 1.1, the host system can in turn provide the drive with rules about how long it should wait before descending to the next lower power state. NVMe 1.3 provides two significant enhancements to power management. The first is a very simple but crucial switch controlling whether a drive in an idle state may exceed the idle power limits to perform background processing like garbage collection. Battery-powered devices seeking to maximize standby time would likely want to disable this permissive mode. Systems that are not operating under strict power limits and are merely trying to minimize unnecessary power use without prohibiting garbage collection would likely want to enable permissive mode rather than leave the drive in a low-power operational state.", "The second major addition to the NVMe power management feature set is Host Controlled Thermal Management. Until now, the temperatures at which NVMe SSDs engage thermal throttling have been entirely model-specific and are not exposed to the host system. The new host controlled thermal management feature allows the host system to specify two temperature thresholds at which the drive should perform light and heavy throttling to reduce the drive's temperature. Most of the details of thermal throttling are still left up to the vendor, including how the drive's various temperature sensors are combined to form the Composite Temperature that the thresholds apply to, and the hysteresis of the throttling (how far below the threshold the temperature must fall before throttling ceases). Drives will continue to include their own built-in temperature limits to prevent damage, but now compact machines like smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks can prevent their SSD from raising other components to undesirable temperatures."]},

The 128Gb 3D XPoint die is 206.5 mm2, much larger than is typical for modern NAND flash or DRAM but comparable to Intel's 128Gb 20nm planar MLC NAND. A large total die size is typical for Intel and Micron, as they have historically not catered to the mobile market with their NAND flash while competitors like Samsung and Toshiba have strived to ensure their flash will physically fit in devices like smartphones.

When comparing similar chips, die size is a strong predictor of manufacturing cost, but 3D XPoint memory is quite different from NAND flash memory, both older planar NAND or newer 3D NAND. Still, there's some value in noting that the P4800X is arriving with a price tag about 25% higher than the P3700 initially carried. This suggests that the manufacturing process for 3D XPoint is either more expensive than planar NAND or that 3D XPoint yields are not mature enough, but a lot of the markup can also be explained by the lack of high-performance competition for Optane SSDs.", "TechInsights calculates that 91.4% of the 3D XPoint die area is occupied by the memory array itself. This is a much higher figure than for NAND flash, where the record is 84.9% for Intel/Micron 3D NAND with its CMOS under the array design that puts a large portion of the peripheral circuitry underneath the memory array instead of alongside. Samsung's current 48-layer 3D V-NAND manages an array efficiency of just 70%, and 3D NAND from Toshiba and SK Hynix has been comparable. This means that once Intel gets around to increasing they layer count in future generations of 3D XPoint memory, they should be able to get much closer to the ideal capacity scaling than 3D NAND memory can currently achieve.", "The analysis from TechInsights confirms that 3D XPoint memory is manufactured using a 20nm process, with the same pitch in both the bitline and wordline directions of the memory array. The DRAM market is only just moving beyond this milestone, so comparing the density of 3D XPoint to current DRAM highlights the fundamental capacity advantage 3D XPoint enjoys: around 4.5 times higher density compared to typical 20nm DRAM, and about 3.3 times higher than the most advanced 1Xnm DDR4 on the market. This gap is likely to widen with future generations of 3D XPoint.", "The materials and construction of an individual 3D XPoint memory cell have not been fully analyzed, but it appears to be a phase change memory element with a doped chalcogenide selector switch.

Western Digital cites reliability and endurance as important selling points of the new SSDs.", "After Western Digital acquired SanDisk, it not only got its own NAND flash manufacturing capacities and became one the most diverse suppliers of storage devices, but also obtained multiple product lineups as well as renowned brands. This is where Western Digital ran into its first dilemma. On the one hand, Western Digital needs to promote its own trademark, after all, it is one of two vertically integrated companies in the world that can produce both HDD and SSD products. On the other hand, SanDisk is one of the very well-known suppliers of NAND flash-based devices (including removable storage and SSDs) and many customers trust this brand. Therefore, Western Digital just cannot cease using the trademark and write down millions in goodwill.", "Meanwhile, to keep SanDisk products competitive, it has to constantly release new devices under the name and this is where Western Digital ran into its second dilemma. On the one hand, it can keep developing different product lines for both brands, which would mean additional R&D and manufacturing costs, as well as internal competition, but which would further diversify its product lineup. On the other hand, it can unify development of certain product families and then just sell the same products under different brands.", "Only time will tell what Western Digital will do with its higher-end and enterprise SanDisk product families, but when it comes to entry-level consumer SSDs, Western Digital decided to go with releasing similar/identical products under the two brands. Such approach makes a lot of sense from the costs standpoint: there is a cut-throat competition on the market of inexpensive SSDs because it is gradually expanding and there are way too many contenders (at least so far) that compete by offering attractive prices of their products, so such strategy makes sense there.", "Given the approach just mentioned, the new WD Blue 3D NAND SATA and the SanDisk Ultra 3D drives share not only 64-layer 3D TLC NAND memory chips, but also a Marvell controller (presumably, the 88S1074 or the 88NV1120) with some additional engineering and in-house developed firmware. Both aforementioned ICs support Marvell's third-gen LDPC-based ECC technology, but the 88NV1120 does not require any DRAM cache to work, lowering BOM of the drives. Western Digital has not confirmed the exact controller it uses, but all modern Marvell SSD ICs support LDPC.", "The new products will be available in 250 GB, 500 GB, 1 TB and 2 TB configurations, but in different form-factors: 2.5/7mm and M.2-2280 for the WD Blue 3D NAND SATA SSDs as well as 2.5/7mm for the SanDisk Ultra 3D SSDs. As for performance, we are talking about up to 560 MB/s sequential read speed and up to 532 MB/s sequential write speed, which is in line with what other consumer-class SATA drives offer nowadays. Since we are dealing with 3D TLC memory here, the firmware uses pseudo-SLC cache to boost write speed, so, write speeds are bursty, depending on how full the cache is. As for random reads and writes, we are looking at 95K IOPS and 84K IOPS, respectively, which is comparable to other mainstream SSDs with the same interface.", "Western Digital rates its 3D TLC NAND-based drives for 1.75 million hours MTBF, which is higher than their drives featuring planar TLC memory, but a bit lower than the MTBF number offered by some competing devices. When it comes to total write ratings, Western Digital also seems to be conservative with its 100 TBW for the 250 GB model, 200 TBW for the 500 GB configuration and so on, even in comparison with ", ". Since the new WD Blue 3D NAND SATA and SanDisk Ultra 3D are Western Digital's first mass market client drives featuring 64-layer 3D TLC NAND chips, it is not surprising that the company decided to go with SATA and moderate reliability/endurance ratings. The firm needs to understand what to expect from mass-production 64-layer 3D TLC NAND on the SSD side of things, which is why it does not want to make big promises. Meanwhile, Western Digital claims in its materials for press that average consumers write about 10 GB of data per day and therefore asserts that its WD Blue 3D NAND SATA and SanDisk Ultra 3D drives will last for years even under heavy workloads.", "Western Digital is not very specific about pricing of the drives. 250 GB versions of the WD Blue 3D NAND SATA and SanDisk Ultra 3D SSDs will cost $99.99 (all form-factors) when they are available in Q3 2017, but the manufacturer does not say a word about MSRPs for other configurations.", "Related Reading:"]},

The 545s is the successor to last year's ", ", which was in many ways a filler product to cover up inconvenient gaps in Intel's SSD technology roadmap. When the 540s launched, Intel's first generation of 3D NAND was not quite ready, and Intel had no cost-competitive planar NAND of their own due to skipping the 16nm node at IMFT. This forced Intel to use 16nm TLC from SK Hynix in the 540s. Less unusual for Intel, the 540s also used a third-party SSD controller: Silicon Motion's SM2258. Silicon Motion's SSD controllers are seldom the fastest, but performance is usually decent and the cost is low. Intel's in-house SATA SSD controllers were enterprise-focused and not ready to compete in the new TLC-based consumer market.", "The Intel SSD 545s continues Intel's close relationship with Silicon Motion by being one of the first SSDs to use the latest SM2259 controller. Since the SATA interface is now a dead-end technology, the SM2259 is a fairly minor update over the SM2258 controller used by last year's Intel SSD 540s. The only significant new feature enabled by the updated controller is hardware end-to-end data protection that includes ECC on the controller's SRAM and on the external DRAM. This will make the 545s more resilient against corruption of in-flight data, but it should not be mistaken for the power loss protection that is typically found on enterprise SSDs.", "The flash memory used in the Intel 545s is Intel's second generation 3D TLC NAND, a 64-layer design with a floating gate memory cell. Intel did not use their first-generation 32-layer 3D NAND in a consumer SATA SSD, but the 32L 3D TLC is at the heart of ", ", their first M.2 NVMe SSD and one of the most affordable consumer NVMe SSDs.", "Similar to the strategy Micron used last year when introducing the ", ", the Intel 545s initially brings a new generation of 3D NAND to the market with just a single SKU. The 512GB 545s is available now on Newegg, with other capacities and the M.2 SATA versions to follow over the next few weeks. The full lineup will include capacities from 128GB to 2TB in both 2.5 and M.2 form factors.", "Intel will be using their smaller 256Gb 64L TLC die for all capacities of the 545s, rather than adopting the 512Gb 64L TLC part for the larger models. The 512Gb die is not yet in volume production and Intel plans to have the full range of 545s models on the market before the 512Gb parts are available in volume. Once the 512Gb parts are available we can expect to seem them used in other product families to enable even higher drive capacities, but it is reassuring to see Intel choosing the performance advantages of smaller more numerous dies for the mainstream consumer product range.", "Meanwhile, over the rest of this year, Intel plans to incorporate 64L 3D NAND into SSDs in every product segment. Most of those products are still under wraps, but the Pro 5450s and E 5100s are on the way as the OEM and embedded versions of the 545s.", "Intel seems to be in a hurry to get this drive out the door so they can claim to be the first shipping SSDs with 64-layer 3D NAND. At Computex we saw ", " due to be available in Q3, and Toshiba is already sampling the ", " to OEMs. Earlier this month, Samsung announced the start of volume production of their 64-layer 256Gb V-NAND. By launching with retail availability this week, Intel has narrowly secured first place bragging rights. (It seems Intel and Micron might have an agreement to take turns introducing new 3D NAND, given that Micron was first to ship the 32L 3D NAND last year with the Crucial MX300.)", "The downside is that this is a rushed launch; I've had the drive in hand for less than five days as of publication time, and that time spanned a weekend. Intel's press briefing on this drive was a mere fifteen hours before the embargo lift, and the slides included some changed specifications relative to the product brief that was delivered with the drive last week. As with several of their recent SSD launches, Intel is only providing the one-page product brief and is withholding the full specifications document from the general public and the press, but this time it might genuinely be due to the latter document not being ready instead of motivated by the questionable IP security concerns Intel cited earlier this year.", "The most significant performance improvement Intel cites for the 545s over the 540s is in sustained sequential transfers where writes exceed the size of the drive's SLC cache. In the briefing for the 545s Intel claimed the 480GB 540s would drop to 40MB/s while the 512GB 545s is capable of maintaining 475MB/s. The numbers given for the 540s are lower than what the full product specifications from last year list (125 MB/s). Without access to the comparable document for the 545s we can't entirely explain this discrepancy, but the most plausible reason is that Intel is no longer measuring sustained write speed restricted to an 8GB span of the drive and that they are now instead using a more sensible test where the drive is full or nearly so. Either way, the 545s should be able to perform much better after its SLC cache is full.", "Externally, the 545s looks like a typical Intel SATA SSD with only minor design variations. Internally, the density of Intel's 3D NAND is readily apparent from the PCB that occupies less than half of the case and features only four NAND packages. With 256Gb (32GB) per die, this works out to four dies per package. Even the largest 2TB model should be able to use this PCB with sixteen dies per package and populating the empty pad for a second DRAM package. The Intel SSD 545s uses thermal pads on all four NAND packages and on the controller.", "The 512GB Intel 545s debuts with a MSRP of $179. This is slightly higher than the launch MSRP of $174 for the 480GB Intel 540s, but on a price per GB basis the 545s is cheaper, and since its launch the MSRP of the 540s has been driven up to $189 by the onset of an industry-wide NAND flash shortage. In this narrow context the MSRP for the 545s may seem reasonable, but its true street price will need to be substantially lower. Intel's 600p NVMe SSD is currently only $175 on Newegg. Since the 600p outperforms any SATA SSD for typical real-world desktop use, the 545s needs to do better than 35¢/GB. The competition based on Micron's 32L 3D TLC includes the Crucial MX300 for around 30¢/GB, and the Samsung 850 EVO 500GB happens to be on sale on Newegg today for $165 (33¢/GB).", "This launch comes at a bit of an awkward time for us. I've retired our aging 2015 SSD testbed and moved all the custom and homemade power measurement equipment over to a new system. Windows 8.1 is out and Windows 10 is in, and our IOmeter synthetic benchmarks are being replaced with Linux-based FIO tests that are more suited to modern TLC SSDs with SLC caches. For the past few weeks I've been focusing my efforts on validating the new testbed and test suite against NVMe SSDs, so the arrival at short notice of a new SATA SSD left me with no relevant comparison data. Given the time available, I chose to prioritize the benchmarks that are most relevant to real-world usage and to run a small selection of competing drives through those tests. This review will be updated with more benchmarks as the drives complete them, and the new SSD 2017 section of our Bench database will be going live soon and will be populated with results from the dozens of drives in our back catalog over the coming weeks.", "For now, this review includes our three AnandTech Storage Bench (ATSB) workloads run on the new testbed, SYSmark 2014 SE and idle power management tests.

The fourth-generation BiCS NAND flash chips from Western Digital feature 96 layers and will include several capacity points and will use TLC and QLC architectures. The company expects to start volume production of BiCS4 chips in 2018.", "NAND dies that belong to the fourth-generation BiCS 3D NAND will use 96 word layers to minimize die size of the chips and maximize output of fabs, and at this point represents the largest layer count in the flash memory industry. Furthermore the range of BiCS4 NAND die configurations available will be considerably more diverse than BiCS3, which currently only includes 256 Gb and 512 Gb dies. Western Digital plans to offer BiCS4 components based on TLC (triple level cell) and QLC (quadruple level cell) configurations. with capacities ranging from 256 Gb to 1 Tb.", "It is noteworthy that Western Digital’s BiCS4 lineup will include QLC NAND, which has been discussed by Western Digital (and SanDisk before that) for several years, but which is about to become reality only in the coming quarters. To store four bits per cell (with 16 voltage states) Western Digital had to use a “thick” process technology alongside multi-layer 3D NAND to keep the per-bit costs down. The company is not specifying how many program/erase cycles its 3D QLC NAND will handle, but various industry predictions over the years have suggested 100 – 150 P/E cycles as a reasonable goal for QLC NAND, which is considerably lower than approximately 1000 P/E cycles supported by TLC NAND. Given such endurance, it is logical to expect 3D QLC NAND to be used for primarily removable storage as well as for ultra-high capacity datacenter drives for the so-called near-WORM (write once read many) storage applications. For example, Toshiba last year discussed a QLC-based datacenter SSD with 100 TB capacity for WORM apps.", "Western Digital plans to begin sampling of select 96-layer BiCS4 3D NAND configurations in the second half of this year, but the manufacturer does not specify which dies will sample when.

Based on Western Digital’s announcements made earlier, the company will gradually introduce more sophisticated BiCS4 96-layer configurations in 2018 and 2019, before moving to BiCS5 sometimes in 2020. That said, it makes sense to expect the highest capacity BiCS4 ICs to ship later rather than sooner.", "Finally, Western Digital did not disclose whether it uses NAND string stacking technology to assemble its 96-layer 3D NAND dies, but it is a likely scenario given what industrial publications have been predicting.", "Related Reading:"]},

Last year the company ", " plans to work with its clients to build software for their software storage offerings to further improve its profit margins, this time from various SSDs. In addition, the company disclosed plans to develop special memory solutions for emerging automotive applications (which will complement its embedded portfolio). This week Micron went even further and disclosed plans to cease selling Lexar branded products to consumers and OEMs as a part of its strategy to increase “opportunities in higher value markets and channels.” The portfolio of Lexar products includes memory cards and card readers, USB flash drives and even SSDs.", "Given the competition on the market of retail removable media and storage drives, the withdrawal from such businesses may be logical for Micron, which feels increasing pressure from Samsung, Western Digital (SanDisk) and others amid lack of market growth in terms of NAND bits (at least, according to its own ", "). Meanwhile, the withdrawal also means that Micron will have to concentrate on production of SSD-grade memory, whereas any further removable storage-grade NAND that the company produces will have be sold on the open market. If someone buys the Lexar operations from Micron, the latter will likely sign some kind of exclusive supply agreement with the new owner, which means that it will keep developing the aforementioned NAND. SSD-grade memory is more expensive than chips for memory cards or USB flash drives. and for about a year Micron was the only company to sell its SSD-grade 3D NAND to third-party SSD vendors, possibly earning higher margins than by selling removable storage devices. However, NAND for the latter is typically used to test drive new production technologies and/or architectures before deploying them to make memory for SSDs.", "Otherwise, looking at the bigger picture, Micron new alignment with regards to the removable storage market is not particularly unique. SK Hynix and Intel don't produce removable storage products either (at least, not under their own trademarks), leaving Samsung, Toshiba and Western Digital as the three remaining vendors who do.

Toshiba does not share further details about its 3D QLC NAND IC (integrated circuit), such as page size, the number of planes as well as interface data transfer rate, but expect the latter to be high enough to build competitive SSDs in late 2018 to early 2019 (that’s our assumption). Speaking of applications that Toshiba expects to use its 3D QLC NAND ICs, the maker of flash memory mentions enterprise and consumer SSDs, tablets and memory cards.", "Besides intention to produce 768 Gb 3D QLC NAND flash for the aforementioned devices, the most interesting part of Toshiba’s announcement is endurance specification for the upcoming components. According to the company, its 3D QLC NAND is targeted for ~1000 program/erase cycles, which is close to TLC NAND flash. This is considerably higher than the amount of P/E cycles (100 – 150) expected for QLC by the industry over the years. At first thought, it comes across a typo - didn't they mean 100?. But the email we received was quite clear:", "It is unclear how Toshiba managed to increase the endurance of its 3D QLC NAND by an order of magnitude versus initially predicted. What we do know is that signal processing is more challenging with QLC than it is with TLC, as each cell needs to accurately determine sixteen different voltage profiles (up from 2 in SLC, 4 in MLC, and 8 in TLC). ", "The easiest way to handle this would be to increase the cell size: by having more electrons per logic level, it is easier to maintain the data and also read from it / write to it. However, the industry is also in a density race, where bits per mm^2 is an issue. Also, to deal with read errors from QLC memory, controllers with very advanced ECC capabilities have to be used for QLC-based SSDs. Toshiba has its own QSBC (Quadruple Swing-By Codes) error correction technique, which it claims to be superior to LDPC (low-density parity-check) that is widely used today for TLC-powered drives. However, there are many LDPC implementations and it is unknown which of them Toshiba used for comparison against its QSBC. Moreover, there are more ECC methods that are often discussed at various industrial events (such as FMS), so Toshiba could be using any or none of them. The only thing that the company tells about its ECC now is that it is stronger than 120 bits/1 KB used today for TLC. In any case, if Toshiba’s statement about 1000 P/E cycles for QLC is correct, it means that that the company knows how to solve both endurance and signal processing challenges.", "The main advantage of QLC NAND is increased storage density when compared to TLC and MLC, assuming the same die size. As was perhaps expected, die size numbers were not provided. However, last year Toshiba and Facebook talked about a case study QLC-powered SSD with 100 TB of capacity for WORM (write once read many) applications and it looks like large-capacity custom drives and memory cards will be the first to use QLC for cold storage. P/E cycles and re-write endurance isn't a concern for WORM at this stage.", "Toshiba has begun to sample its 3D QLC NAND memory devices earlier this month to various parties to enable development of SSDs and SSD controllers.

It remains to be seen when the fab in Pyeongtaek starts to manufacture DRAM ICs, which are also in short supply nowadays.

Contemporary SSD controllers contain multiple computing cores and perform rather intensive mathematical operations in order to work with modern NAND flash memory properly and correct read errors that occur with the latest types of flash (and thus guarantee their endurance rating). As a result, sometimes those controllers overheat on M.2 drives because of insufficient cooling and begin to throttle, reducing performance. Going forward, SSD controllers will become even more complex, especially as the industry moves to higher bit densities with TLC and then QLC architectures. Developers of such controllers will likely try to keep their TDPs in check by using lower-power compute cores and/or low-power process technologies, but it remains to be seen whether temperatures of next-gen controllers will be lower than temperatures of modern ones.", "Various industry players attempt to ensure proper cooling of M.2 SSDs by equipping their drives with thermal pads (Samsung) or heatsinks (Plextor), offering heatsinks with motherboards (MSI) or selling aftermarket thermal pads (", ").

The new drives are equipped with a radiator to avoid performance throttling, and while using the M.2 form factor, will only fit into desktops as a consequence.", "Over the past few quarters ADATA become one the largest independent vendors of 3D NAND-based SSDs due to the fact that it has managed to secure supply of 3D TLC and 3D MLC NAND flash from Micron. So far, the company has introduced multiple 3D NAND-based SSDs, including drives with SATA and PCIe/NVMe interfaces featuring different controllers from Silicon Motion and Maxiotek. The ADATA XPG SX7000-series drives powered by the SMI SM2260 controller and Micron’s 3D TLC NAND are among of the company’s recently launched drives aimed at performance mainstream PCs. As it appears, in the near future such SSDs will be joined by the new XPG Gammix S10 family, which use the same controller and 3D TLC NAND memory from Micron, but are equipped with a radiator to ensure lack of overheating and consistent performance. ADATA is not commenting on whether the XPG SX7000 and the XPG Gammix S10 are essentially the same SSDs, but they have exactly the same performance numbers and even their model numbers look similar (ASX7000NP-512GT-C => ASX7000NPC-512GT-C).", "Speaking of performance, we know a lot what to expect from the SMI SM2260 in general and from the ADATA XPG SX7000/Gammix S10 in particular. As mentioned in the initial XPG SX7000 coverage, the drives are very different from each other due to the level of parallelism afforded by the controller/NAND combinations. The 512 GB models are rated for sequential read speeds up to 1750 MB/s, while sequential writes can reach up to 860 MB/s when pseudo-SLC caching is used. As for random performance, the 512 GB drive can offer up to 130K/140K 4 KB read/write IOPS. When it comes to the XPG SX7000/XPG Gammix S10 128 GB, the lowest capacity of the set, we are dealing with a drive capable of up to 660/450 MB/s sequential read/write performance as well as 35K/95K read/write IOPS.", "This drive is slightly faster than SATA SSDs based on TLC NAND, but it should offer higher endurance because 3D TLC NAND is made using larger process technologies and can account for voltage drift better. Keep in mind that the XPG Gammix S10 are equipped with a radiator and therefore their performance under load may be slightly higher when compared to the predecessor. In the meantime, the XPG Gammix S10 will hardly fit into laptops because of its dimensions.", "Meanwhile when it comes to endurance ratings, the ADATA XPG SX7000 and the XPG Gammix S10 are, again, exactly the same: the 128 GB SSD is rated for 80 TBW, the 512 GB version is capable of 320 TBW and the 1 TB model can handle 640 TBW (equals to around 0.3 DWPD (drive writes per day) across the warranty lifetime). Both SSD series come with a five-year limited warranty and are rated for 2 million hours MTBF.", "ADATA did not announce MSRPs for the XPG Gammix S10 SSDs, but since the new drives are essentially the XPG SX7000 products equipped with radiators, do not expect their actual prices to be significantly different.", "Related Reading:"]},

The new ICs stack 8 or 16 3D NAND devices using through silicon vias (TSVs) and are currently among the highest capacity non-volatile memory stacks available in the industry. Commercial products powered by the 512 GB and 1 TB packages are expected to hit the market in 2018, with an initial market focus on high-end enterprise SSDs", "Stacking NAND devices to build high capacity flash memory ICs has been used for years to maximize the capacities and performance of SSDs and other solid state storage devices. In many cases, NAND makers use wire-bonding technique to stack multiple memory devices, but it makes packages larger and requires a lot of power for reliable operation. However in more recent years, Toshiba has adopted ", " previously used for ASIC and DRAM devices to stack its NAND ICs, which has enabled it to shrink size of its NAND packages and reduce their power consumption.", "TSVs are essentially electrodes that penetrate the entire thickness of a silicon die and connect the dies above and below it in the stack. A bus formed by TSVs can operate at a high data transfer rate, consume less power, and take up less space than a bus made using physical wires. Since 3D NAND is based on vertically stacked memory layers and has numerous vertical interconnects, so far Toshiba has not used TSVs to interconnect such devices. To wed TSV and 3D NAND, Toshiba had to develop a special 512 Gb BiCS NAND die featuring appropriate electrical conductors.", "It is noteworthy that the company used its 48-layer 2", " generation BiCS architecture instead of the 64-layer 3", " gen BiCS to design the 512 Gb 3D TLC NAND device. The reasons for such design decision are not obvious. On the one hand, 48-layers could minimize the height of the 8-high and 16-high stacks. On the other hand, Toshiba could opt for a lower number of layers because it is using a thicker process technology to build the 3D TLC NAND devices in a bid to improve their endurance (thus, a structure with fewer layers is meant to keep height in check).", "Toshiba’s 512 GB and 1 TB 3D TLC NAND ICs use a 1066 MT/s Toggle DDR interface, which is one of the advantages that the use of TSVs has enabled. Another advantage enabled by TSVs is a near doubling of Toshiba's data transfer energy efficiency relative to their existing BiCS2-based products that use wire bonding, according to the manufacturer.", "The 512 GB and 1 TB 3D TLC NAND chips from Toshiba come in 14×18 mm packages and use the industry-standard dual x8 BGA-152 interface. The standard pinout is important because the ICs will be used primarily for high capacity SSDs used in servers. In fact, apart from their high density, the 1066 MT/s interface and overall energy efficiency will be the two significant benefits for datacenter-class drives. Further down the line, 512 GB and 1 TB 3D TLC NAND chips will also enable Toshiba and its partners to build 2.5 SSDs with 15 – 30 TB of usable capacity (Samsung uses 512 GB packages to build its flagship ", ") and go even higher with 3.5 drives.", "Toshiba has already started to ship prototypes of its 512 GB and 1 TB 3D TLC NAND chips for development purposes, and plans to start sampling the 8-high and 16-high flash memory ICs in the second half of 2017.

The Viking UHC-Silo drives use planar eMLC NAND memory in custom packaging with raw NAND capacities of 25 TB and 50 TB, and consequently are currently the highest capacity SSDs available on the market.", "An increasing number of datacenters these days use both SSDs and HDDs, balancing the high performance of SSDs with HDDs' ability to store huge amounts of data relatively cheaply. Meanwhile, there is an emerging category of all-flash or hybrid storage systems that either do not use hard drives at all, or use HDDs mostly for things like “cold” archives. Such systems are rather energy efficient and offer high performance thanks to the heavy use of solid state storage.", "Nevertheless, when it comes to bulk storage, their requirements are similar to the requirements of datacenters using HDDs: maximum capacity per cubic meter, maximum capacity per watt, high availability, and predictable cost per GB. Viking’s UHC-Silo SSDs were designed for the aforementioned kinds of applications — in some cases, they are going to replace hard drives for huge databases or even “cold” storage, in other cases they are going to sit between “warm” and “cold” storage. Given that many applications may benefit from SSDs, demand for high-capacity flash storage devices is growing in general.", "The Viking UHC-Silo SSDs come in a 3.5” form-factor (a rarity for any kind of SSD) and utilize a SAS 6 Gbps interface, two features that make the drives particularly well-suited for replacing high capacity HDDs. The drives are designed for mixed workloads that do not generate more than 1 DWPD and do not require very high performance. The UHC-Silo SSDs offer sustained sequential read/write speed of 500/350 MB/s as well as up to 60,000/15,000 random read/write IOPS, which is in line with other extreme capacity SATA SSDs and is a result of their internal architecture and limitations of contemporary controllers. In fact, given the UHC-Silo's performance limitations (350 MB/s sustained write speed), it's impossible to write more than 30 TB of data in a single day. So while the 25 TB version can physically support 1 DWPD over five years (this is what Viking guarantees), the 50 TB model cannot physically support more than 0.6 DWPD. The latter fact essentially means that, assuming Viking's sustained performance figures are reasonably accurate, the TBW rating of the 50 TB SKU (91.25 PB) cannot be physically exceeded during the warranty period.", "The UHC-Silo drives are based on a custom-built proprietary controller that's paired with eMLC NAND from SK Hynix, which is acquired in wafer form and then cut, tested and packaged in house. In fact, Viking’s proprietary packaging is what enables these drives of rather extreme capacities. SK Hynix officially sells 2048 Gb (256 GB) MLC packages containing 16 128 Gb NAND devices. If Viking used these off-the shelf packages, it would require 100 of them for the 25 TB drive and 200 of them for the 50 TB SSD. Since it is impossible to pack 100 or 200 chips into a 3.5” SSD, Viking uses proprietary NAND packages to build its UHC-Silo drives. The company does not disclose information about its custom NAND chips and does not freely show the internals of the drives because the packaging is one of its key trade secrets.", "The proprietary controller that Viking uses supports BCH-based 55 bit/512 byte ECC with end-to-end CRC protection to enable a <1 in 10", " bits read bit error rate. The drives also support data recovery from sector, page and block failure, but for some reason the standard versions listed on the company’s web site do not have any power failure data protection. Meanwhile, since such drives are usually bought for a particular project and are built-to-order, clients may ask Viking to add this feature (and not only this) for an additional fee. Viking stresses that the controller supports NAND from different vendors and thus it can switch between suppliers if it needs to.", "Viking says that its UHC-Silo SSDs are the highest-capacity SSDs available on the market today. From raw capacity standpoint, the UHC-Silo are exactly what Viking claims them to be: nobody else offers 25 and 50 TB SSDs in a 3.5” form-factor. Meanwhile, Viking had to make significant tradeoffs between performance, capacity, power and compatibility, which is why its drives are considerably slower than some of their direct rivals, such as NGD’s Catalina 24 TB SSD (up to 3.9 GB/s throughput) and Samsung’s PM1633a 15.36 TB drive (up to 1.9/0.9 GB/s read/write). Since there are loads of potential customers requiring massive SSDs for their existing 3.5” SAS backplanes, Viking had to use this interface and could design the drives' capabilities around its limitations.", "But perhaps most surprisingly, despite the industry-leading capacity of their drives, Viking is keeping the overall prices of the drives relatively reasonable. The actual prices of the Viking UHC-Silo SSDs are not published (remember that they can be customized), but the manufacturer says that the two drives are priced at around $0.40 per GB. This would put the 25 TB drive at approximately $10,000, whereas the 50 TB version would run for $20,000. By contrast, the aforementioned Samsung PM1633a 15.36 TB SSD costs ", ", or $0.73 per GB.", "Related Reading:"]},

This fourth generation V-NAND is now in mass production and will be rolling out to many product segments over the coming months. Most products will be using either 256Gb or 512Gb TLC dies. Compared to the 48-layer third generation V-NAND, the 64-layer V-NAND offers the same read performance but approximately 11% higher write performance. Power consumption has been improved more significantly, with the current required for a read operation dropping by 12% and for a program operation the current required has decreased by 25%. Samsung claims their 64-layer V-NAND in a TLC configuration can last for 7,000 to 20,000 program/erase cycles.", "Samsung has now also announced their fifth-generation V-NAND, which will increase the layer count further to 96 layers with relatively few other changes to the design. The fifth generation will include Samsung's first QLC NAND flash (four bits per cell), with a capacity of 1Tb (128GB) per die.", "Beyond the fifth generation, Samsung says they may start using techniques like string stacking, putting the peripheral logic under the memory array, or shrinking the horizontal dimensions of their flash. String stacking is more or less inevitable if the layer count is to continue increasing, but it is not clear exactly when that transition will be worthwhile. At the moment, Samsung estimates string stacking would increase production costs by about 15% due to the extra process steps involved, and aligning a second stack of 3D NAND layers will present serious yield challenges. Putting the peripheral logic under the memory array has worked well for the 3D NAND from Intel and Micron, and Samsung estimates it could reduce their own die sizes by 20-30%. Shrinking the horizontal dimensions of their NAND flash memory cells also offers a way to increase density and improve price per GB, but that path leads to the same endurance and reliability problems that eventually made planar NAND a dead end technology.", "Samsung provided an update on Z-NAND memory, their near-term solution for offering lower latency than existing flash memory. In the long run, non-flash persistent memory technologies will be required, but by modifying their existing 3D V-NAND architecture they have an SLC-based memory that offers 3µs read latencies, 15 times faster than their V-NAND flash memory (whether that's comparing against MLC or TLC V-NAND was not specified). Their first Z-NAND product, the Z-SSD SZ985, offers overall random read latencies of less than 15µs, which is 5.5 times faster than their TLC-based enterprise SSDs. Samsung also announced a second generation Z-NAND, this time based on MLC NAND instead of SLC. This sacrifices a bit of performance (5µs read latency compared to 3µs) but offers much better storage density. Looking beyond Z-NAND for new memory technologies, Samsung is working on both phase-change memory and spin-torque magnetoresistive RAM (ST-MRAM).", "Samsung's SSD announcements based on the above V-NAND technologies include a 128TB 2.5 SAS SSD based on QLC V-NAND. For this drive, Samsung will be stacking 32 dies per package, for a total of 4TB in each BGA device.", "Samsung is also previewing a proposed new enterprise SSD form factor they are referring to as NGSFF for now. This form factor uses a 30.5mm by 110mm PCB, substantially wider than the most commonly implemented M.2 form factors and wide enough to accommodate two rows of flash packages. The PCB is mounted on a metal carrier that allows the drive to be used in a new hot-swappable backplane. Samsung is demonstrating a reference 1U server design codenamed Mission Peak that achieves a total capacity of 576TB through the use of 36 PM983 SSDs in the NGSFF form factor, each with a 16TB capacity. The motivation and benefits of this style of form factor are the same as for Intel's newly announced Ruler form factor: M.2 offers great density but isn't hot-swappable, and high-capacity 2.5 SSDs are hard to cool effectively when they stack two PCBs inside a closed 15mm case. Samsung has not mentioned whether they intend to participate in making NGSFF into an industry standard.", "The drive Samsung is using to feature the NGSFF form factor is the PM983. The controller on this SSD is Samsung's Phoenix, likely the successor to the Polaris controller used in the retail 960 series and Samsung's other recent M.2 NVMe SSDs.", "Moving slightly higher in the storage technology stack, Samsung is developing a new specialized software interface for enterprise SSDs. Rather than use block-based addressing, Samsung's PM983K presents a key/value storage interface similar to what is used by many NoSQL databases. Samsung claims this allows for significant performance scaling improvements compared to running RocksDB on a standard PM983, and that it leads to a huge reduction in write amplification. Samsung hasn't discussed the low-level details of the key-value interface, but it may be implemented using the NVMe 1.3 Directives feature, which would give Samsung an easy path to standardization.", "Separately from the key/value interface, Samsung's enterprise SSDs are now adopting the NVMe 1.3 Controller Memory Buffer feature and implementing the IO Determinism feature that has been approved for the next NVMe standard. That feature allows for separating the SSD into sets of namespaces that reside on physically separate NAND chips and channels, so that operations on one set will not be able to block operations on another set."]},

The first SSDs in the ruler form-factor will be available “in the near future” and the form-factor itself is here for a long run: it is expandable in terms of interface performance, power, density and even dimensions.", "For many years SSDs relied on form-factors originally designed for HDDs to ensure compatibility between different types of storage devices in PCs and servers. Meanwhile, the 2.5” and the 3.5” form-factors are not always optimal for SSDs in terms of storage density, cooling, and other aspects. To better address client computers and some types of servers, Intel developed the M.2 form-factor for modular SSDs several years ago. While such drives have a lot of advantages when it comes to storage density, they were not designed to support such functionality as hot-plugging, whereas their cooling is a yet another concern. By contrast, the ruler form-factor was developed specifically for server drives and is tailored for requirements of datacenters. As Intel puts it, the ruler form-factor “delivers the most storage capacity for a server, with the lowest required cooling and power needs”.", "From technical point of view, each ruler SSD is a long hot-swappable module that can accommodate tens of NAND flash or 3D XPoint chips, and thus offer capacities and performance levels that easily exceed those of M.2 modules.", "The initial ruler SSDs will use the SFF-TA-1002 Gen-Z connector, supporting PCIe 3.1 x4 and x8 interfaces with a maximum theoretical bandwidth of around 3.94 GB/s and 7.88 GB/s in both directions. Eventually, the modules could gain an x16 interface featuring 8 GT/s, 16 GT/s (PCIe Gen 4) or even 25 - 32 GT/s (PCIe Gen 5) data transfer rate (should the industry need SSDs with ~50 - 63 GB/s throughput). In fact, connectors are ready for PCIe Gen 5 speeds even now, but there are no hosts to support the interface.", "One of the key things about the ruler form-factor is that it was designed specifically for server-grade SSDs and therefore offers a lot more than standards for client systems. For example, when compared to the consumer-grade M.2, a PCIe 3.1 x4-based EDSFF ruler SSD has extra SMBus pins for NVMe management, additional pins to charge power loss protection capacitors separately from the drive itself (thus enabling passive backplanes and lowering their costs). The standard is set to use +12 V lane to power the ruler SSDs and Intel expects the most powerful drives to consume 50 W or more.", "Servers and backplanes compatible with the rulers will be incompatible with DFF SSDs and HDDs, as well as with other proprietary form-factors (so, think of flash-only machines). EDSFF itself has yet to be formalized as a standard, however the ", " for the standard already counts Dell, Lenovo, HPE, and Samsung as among its promotors, and Western Digital as one of several contributors.", " ", "It is also noteworthy that Intel has been shipping ruler SSDs based on planar MLC NAND to select partners (think of the usual suspects - large makers of servers as well as owners of huge datacenters) for about eight months now. While the drives did not really use all the advantages of the proposed standard – and I'd be surprised if they were even compliant with the final standard – they helped the EDSFF working group members prepare for the future. Moreover, some of Intel's partners have even added their features to the upcoming EDSFF standard, and still other partners are looking at using the form factor for GPU and FPGA accelerator devices. So it's clear that there's already a lot of industry interest and now growing support for the ruler/EDSFF concept.", "Finally, one of the first drives to be offered in the ruler form-factor will be Intel’s DC P4500-series SSDs, which feature Intel’s enterprise-grade 3D NAND memory and a proprietary controller.

The live demos showed that Seagate has implemented support for the Streams feature from the ", ", and IO determinism which has been approved for the next revision of the NVMe specification.", "The Streams demo illustrated how tagging write operations according to which task they belong to allows the SSD to keep related writes together and put unrelated data in separate erase blocks. When used properly, data from the same stream can be expected to have a similar lifetime, so when part of it gets invalidated or overwritten, everything in that erase block will also soon be available for garbage collection. With the longer-lived data stored elsewhere, the SSD has far less data to move and compact during its garbage collection process, which leads to lower write amplification and improved performance. For the test scenario Seagate concocted, they were able to show write amplification being reduced from around 8.6-9 down to about 1.03, while throughput for the worker thread that was shown on screen improved from around 9.7k IOPS to 83k IOPS.", "The new NVMe IO Determinism feature serves a similar purpose, but implements it in a very different way. NVMe Streams directives are essentially hints to the SSD controller about how to physically organize data. The IO Determinism feature asks the SSD to make hard guarantees by dividing its flash chips and channels into separate NVM Sets. IO to one set will never block access to another set because the data resides on different physical chips. Saturating the PCIe link or overloading the controller's available CPU power would be the only ways for one task to degrade another's IO performance. The downside to this static partitioning method is that a single task accessing one NVM Set will not be able to use the full performance or capacity of the drive, even if there are no other tasks accessing the drive.", "The IO Determinism feature also provides for timeslicing access to the SSD, where the drive can provide a window for deterministic IO where background garbage collection is suspended, followed by a non-deterministic period where normal access is permitted by performance may be degraded as the garbage collector catches up. This is essentially a standardization of the ", " for its Saber 1000 enterprise SATA SSDs in 2015.", "Seagate also showed off two unannounced prototypes that they had not planned to feature at their booth. The first was dubbed the Nytro 5000B, a variant of the Nytro 5000 M.2 SSD that is intended as a high-performance boot drive. This was commissioned by a large customer that did not wish to be named. The drive included 256GB of 3D MLC NAND and 2GB of DRAM, plus a connection to an external pack of capacitors. With such a large bank of capacitors, the 5000B can be far more aggressive about caching both metadata and user data in DRAM, allowing for burst write performance far in excess of what the flash could sustain, and without compromising data safety.", "The other prototype had similar aims, but instead of a capacitor-backed bank of DRAM it featured 128MB of Everspin STT-MRAM in addition to a normal DRAM cache for metadata. Seagate envisions using the MRAM either as a write cache for user data, or exposing it directly as a separate storage namespace for explicit tiered storage. This MRAM prototype drive was not a preview of an upcoming product. Instead, Seagate views this as a test platform to explore the possibilities and performance characteristics of MRAM, now that it is available in useful capacities."]},

External high-speed interfaces such as USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Thunderbolt 3 have also become ubiquitous. The advent of Type-C has also enabled device vendors to agree upon a standardized connector for their equipment (be it mobile devices or desktop PCs). These advances have led to the appearance of small and affordable direct attached storage units with very high performance for day-to-day data transfer applications.", "Samsung has been an active participant in the high-performance external SSD market with their Portable SSD series. The T1 was introduced in ", ", while the T3 came out in ", ". The T3 was the first retail product to utilize Samsung's 48-layer TLC V-NAND. Today, Samsung is launching the Portable SSD T5. It is a retail pilot vehicle for their 64-layer TLC V-NAND as they ramp up its production. The Portable SSD T5 comes in four different capacity points - 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB. It also moves up to a USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C interface, while retaining the same compact form factor and hardware encryption capabilities of the Portable SSD T3.", "​The important features of the Portable SSD T5 series are summarized below:", "The Portable SSD T5 series is available for purchase today, starting at $130 for the 250GB model. Samsung sampled us the 500GB and 2TB variants for evaluation.", "The T5's form factor is very similar to that of the T3. It is not a thumb drive, but it is definitely compact (dimensions of 74 x 57.3 x 10.5mm) and lightweight (51g). Samsung claims that it is shock-resistant, and can withstand a 2m fall. The USB-C port is the only visible opening in the T5's case. There are four screws well-hidden by seamless stickers. The package also comes with two 0.5m cables - 1x USB Type-C male to Type-A male, and 1x USB Type-C male to Type-C male. Both are obviously rated for USB 3.1 Gen 2 operation.", "Prior to looking at the internals, CrystalDiskInfo provides us some insight. We only look at the 2TB variant here (the 500GB version is quite similar).", "Despite the indication of S.M.A.R.T support, the relevant data was not visible to most of the commonly used tools. On the USB side, the drive supports UASP (USB-attached SCSI Protocol) that should provide increased performance for sequential transfers. Claimed transfer rates are 540 MBps for sequential accesses, which essentially means that the SATA interface of the internal SSD can be saturated. We also have hardware-accelerated AES-256 encryption. In the rest of this section, we will take a look at the internal hardware followed by some usage impressions.", "Compared to the T1 and T3, the T5 proved to be very easy to disassemble, needing only two out of the four screws to be removed. The internal PCB could then be easily slid out. Various pictures from our disassembly process (including shots of the heavy thermal protection) are available in the galleries below.", "The teardown of the 2TB version shows the ASMedia ASM235CM bridge chip on the board with the Type-C connector. Attached to the board is a mSATA device with four flash packages, a SSD controller, and a single DRAM package. The four flash packages all carry the K9DUGB8H1A tag, while the controller is the standard MGX one used in the 850 EVO series (S4LN062X01). The DRAM part number is K4E8E164EB-SGCF 8Gbit package, pointing to 1GB of LPDDR3 (the same as the Portable SSD T3 2TB version). The mSATA segment of the Portable SSD T5 2TB is essentially the same as that of the Portable SSD T3 2TB, except for the four flash packages.", "The 500GB teardown was similar to the 2TB version. The only difference was in the mSATA card. Instead of four, we have only two flash packages. The part number is also different (K9OMGY8H5A) since we only need 250GB per package, and that can be achieved with just half the number of dies that need to be in the package of the 2TB version. The DRAM part number (K4E4E16-4EESGCE) indicates 512MB of LPDDR3. Overall, it is again similar to the 500GB 850 EVO, except for the flash packages.", "The other side of the mSATA PCB, despite having no flash packages, is protected by a thermal pad between the board and the internal plastic frame.", "The Portable SSD T5 comes with security disabled by default. The default exFAT partition is mounted automatically upon connecting to a PC. If the Samsung Portable SSD software in the partition is installed, a password can be set up to enable security / encryption. If a password has been set before, a 83MB FAT32 partition is mounted first. This read-only partition has a copy of the Portable SSD software which can be used to enter the password and unlock the drive. Therefore, deleting the Portable SSD installer in the main partition is perfectly fine even if encryption has been enabled.", "Coming back to the usage aspects, the exFAT volume is available without installing any special programs on both Windows and Mac OS systems. Linux users might need to install an external package to get exFAT support. Though Samsung claims Android support for the unit, it is only for the encryption aspect. The Portable SSD app allows users to enable / disable / unlock the encryption (security) on a drive.", "We attached the T5 to a Huawei Nexus 6P using the Type-C to Type-C cable that came along with the phone. There was no trouble accessing the drive on the phone. The only caveat is that Android doesn't support exFAT. Samsung's updated Portable SSD app still doesn't enable exFAT support. In any case, the Nexus 6P force-formatted the T5 in FAT32, but, after that, there was no issue in transferring data between the phone and a PC using the T5. Android compatibility is nice to have, but we would definitely like Samsung to provide exFAT support through the Portable SSD app."]},

Corsair's ", " and Force LE SATA drives and their ", " don't offer anything unique under Corsair's sticker. The new Corsair Neutron NX500 uses the same Phison E7 controller as the MP500, but it aims to stand out from the crowd.", "The Corsair Neutron NX500 is not the first retail Phison E7 SSD to use the PCIe add-in card form factor with a heatsink, but it is the first to reserve a very large spare area, leaving just 400GB usable space on our sample compared to the typical 480GB. This kind of high overprovisioning ratio is usually only found on enterprise SSDs intended for write-heavy workloads. We saw these oddball capacities with the ", ", but there it was due in part to Intel's 18-channel controller compared to 4 or 8 channels on most consumer drives. The Corsair NX500 actually has substantially more overprovisioning than the Intel SSD 750.", "The custom heatsink makes the Corsiar Neutron NX500 visually quite distinct as it carries typical Corsair styling cues. The PCIe bracket is perforated with triangular vents that match the ", ", while the rest of the drive is decked in variations on black. We know from our past testing of Phison E7 drives that the heatsink's role is more aesthetic than functional, but as the heaviest SSD heatsink I've yet encountered it should guarantee that the controller stays cool. The NX500 does not include any thermal pads between the heatsink and the flash memory, and there are no thermal pads between the drive and the backplate. The faux carbon fiber plastic shroud over part of the NX500's heatsink could theoretically detract from its cooling capacity, but the wattage of the Phison E7 chip is far too low to for that to matter.", "The PCB under the NX500's heatsink is barely modified from the Phison reference design. It does actually bear Corsair's name, but the overall layout is identical to all the other Phison E7 PCIe cards we've seen, right down to the unpopulated solder pads for power loss protection capacitors—both cylindrical through-hole capacitors and surface-mount solid capacitors are provided for. A custom PCB half the size could have worked without making the board crowded. The flash is the usual Toshiba 15nm MLC. The NX500 is equipped with twice as much DRAM as is typical for a SSD with this much NAND flash.", "Quite unsurprisingly given the overprovisioning situation, the Corsair Neutron NX500 comes with a firmware version we have not previously encountered on other Phison E7 products. The NX500 ships with firmware version E7FM04.5, which I'll abbreviate as version 4.5. We've previously dealt with versions 1.0, 2.0 and 2.1, and an upcoming review will feature a 240GB drive using version 3.6.", "An NVMe SSD in the PCIe add-in card form factor with a big heatsink and using MLC NAND is obviously a niche product for the high end of the market. It makes sense that Corsair's starting the NX500 line with 400GB and 800GB capacities while the more mainstream MP500 M.2 SSD ranges from 120GB to 480GB. Corsair rates the NX500 with a total write endurance of 698TB for the 400GB model (the same as their 480GB MP500) and 1396TB for the 800GB model, but the NX500 comes with a five-year warranty compared to the MP500's three years.", "This review has two goals: to compare the NX500's overprovisioning and other firmware changes against earlier Phison E7 drives, and to compare the NX500 against the broader field of current NVMe SSDs with similar capacities.

Later on, the company plans to switch to Toshiba’s 3D MLC NAND for a product that will succeed the SX9000 SSD series.", "The ADATA XPG SX9000 SSDs use the Marvell 88SS1093 BTB2 controller, which sports three processor cores and 8 NAND channels, with 4 banks per channel for 32 targets in total. The IC is an improved version of the 88SS1093 with higher frequencies and performance to boost speeds of higher-end SSDs. The 88SS1093 BTB2 supports a Marvell’s third-generation ECC technology based on the LDPC algorithm and uses PCIe 3.0 x4 interface.", "The new XPG SX9000 drives are to be available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB configurations in the M.2-2280 form-factor. The SSDs use DRAM buffers for additional performance, and come with a very basic heat spreader to further prop up performance in systems that provide adequate cooling. Speaking of performance, ADATA promises up to 2.8 GB/s sequential read speed as well as up to 1.45 GB/s sequential write speed for the top-of-the-range 1 TB model. As for random read/write performance, ADATA lists 310K/240K IOPS for the most advanced model.", "Reliability is another thing that ADATA is taking serious when it comes to the XPG SX9000.

{"title": "Silicon Motion Roadmap: Lots Of NVMe SSD Controllers", "paragraph": ["At Flash Memory Summit (FMS) this month, Silicon Motion demonstrated several of their upcoming NVMe SSD controllers and engineers presented several of the technologies Silicon Motion has developed for these controllers. Between the exhibit and the technical presentations, a total of six upcoming SSD controllers were mentioned.", "Currently, most SSDs using Silicon Motion controllers feature either the SM2258 SATA controller or the SM2260 NVMe controller. The SM2258XT is a DRAMless variant of the SM2258. Silicon Motion's new SM2259 SATA controller recently debuted in the ", ", but hasn't been spotted in any other consumer products yet and there are still new SM2258 products being announced. Silicon Motion hasn't shared much information on the SM2259 and it doesn't even appear on their website yet, but thanks to the presentations at FMS we now know that one of the key improvements over the SM2258 is Silicon Motion's second-generation LDPC encoder. Like the SM2260 NVMe controller, the SM2259 uses a 2kb codeword size instead of the 1kb codeword size used by the SM2256 and SM2258 SATA controllers. As a result of the larger codeword size and other changes to the LDPC system, the SM2259 can offer much higher error correction throughput and tolerate a higher error rate than its predecessors. The improved performance comes at the cost of requiring significantly more die area on the controller and higher power draw, but our test results from the Intel SSD 545s indicate these tradeoffs were worthwhile.", "Silicon Motion's upcoming generation of NVMe SSD controllers will have four members to cover a broader range of the market than the current SM2260. The low-end NVMe SSD market will be served by the SM2263 and its DRAMless counterpart SM2263XT. These controllers still use up to four lanes of PCIe 3.0, but are equipped with only four channels on the flash interface side, the same as Silicon Motion's SATA controllers. The DRAMless SM2263XT will also be used for BGA SSDs that stack the NAND flash on top of the controller in a single package. Both the PCIe x4 16mm by 20mm package standard and the PCIe x2 11.5mm by 13mm package standard are usable by the SM2263XT for BGA SSDs. As with most DRAMless NVMe controllers, the SM2263XT supports the NVMe Host Memory Buffer feature that allows it to use a small portion of the host system's DRAM to avoid most of the performance penalties that DRAMless SATA SSDs suffer from.", "The most direct successor to the SM2260 will be the SM2262. This is another 8-channel controller intended for high performance client and consumer SSDs. The SM2262 uses the same package and pinout as the SM2260 but will offer much higher performance. Reliability and write endurance should also be improved due to the inclusion of the same LDPC upgrades present in the SM2259 SATA SSD controller. Lastly for the upcoming generation, the SM2262EN will be a higher-performance counterpart to the plain SM2262. The -EN version is intended to help Silicon Motion break into the enterprise SSD market, but given its performance specifications it will probably also be used in several enthusiast-oriented consumer SSDs. To help ensure the SM2262EN is suitable for the enterprise market, Silicon Motion has added end-to-end data path protection including ECC on all the internal SRAM buffers. The other three controllers in this generation also get this benefit due to the shared architecture across the product family.", "Future NVMe controllers beyond the -62/63 generation will include the SM2264 and SM2270. These haven't been officially announced but a few details have been released. At Computex our friends at ", " showing SM2264 as their first controller supporting PCIe 4.0. With four PCIe lanes and an eight channel flash interface, the SM2264 would be the successor to the SM2262 (and possibly also the SM2262EN). Both the SM2264 and SM2270 will feature Silicon Motion's third-generation LDPC encoder, now supporting 4kb codewords as part of an error correction system designed to meet the needs of QLC NAND. When paired with QLC NAND, the SM2264 and SM2270 will allow Silicon Motion to compete in the new product segment of capacity-optimized PCIe SSDs. Most of these will be enterprise SSDs, but if ", " for 64+ layer 3D QLC NAND write endurance are to be believed, QLC may also have a place in the consumer SSD market.", "Silicon Motion didn't have much to say at FMS about the timeline for these controllers. However, the fact that there were live demos of both the SM2263 and SM2262EN speaks volumes. The hardware for the upcoming generation is ready and the firmware is not entirely polished but is good enough to deliver record-setting performance when paired with Intel's 64-layer 3D NAND. With current speeds of around 3.5GB/s for sequential reads and 3GB/s for sequential writes (at QD32, as measured by CrystalDiskMark) and with random read and write speeds of about 75MB/s and 300MB/s respectively at QD1, the SM2262EN has a serious chance of challenging even Samsung's NVMe SSDs in just a few months time. The limiting factor will most likely be availability of 64-layer 3D NAND.", "The SM2264 was previously revealed to be planned for the end of 2018, which means it could start showing up in products in the spring of 2019. The PCIe 4.0 hardware ecosystem will still be in its infancy at that time, so SSD vendors will probably not be in a hurry to deploy SM2264 except for use with QLC NAND. Since the SM2270 controller was not shown on any of Silicon Motion's roadmaps and was only mentioned in the context of the third-generation LDPC encoder, we don't have any indication of which market segments it will target or when it will be available."]},
{"title": "Lite-On SSDs At FMS: New Controllers And TSV NAND Packaging", "paragraph": ["Lite-On (including its consumer SSD brand Plextor) is one of the largest SSD vendors that is not vertically integrated. They don't manufacture NAND flash memory and don't design their own SSD controllers. Their strategy for competing against the vertically-integrated giants relies on picking the right technologies that are available on the open market and making the most of them with in-house firmware development. This makes Lite-On a great source for second opinions about new NAND flash and SSD controller silicon; they have to make their own judgments about whether new technologies are as great as the manufacturers claim, and they get to do so long before we get retail products to test. Lite-On's plans for exhibiting at Flash Memory Summit earlier this month were upended by the fire that closed the show floor for the entire duration of the conference, but they did manage to show me some of the products and prototypes from their booth.", "The most predictable product Lite-On had to show was the new iteration of their EP series of entry-level enterprise NVMe SSDs. Lite-On is still using Marvell's 88SS1093 Eldora controller, but now pairing it with Toshiba's 64-layer BiCS3 3D TLC NAND flash. The result is a M.2 22110 drive with capacities up to 2TB, write endurance rated at 1DWPD, and performance that's nothing special for a read-oriented enterprise NVMe drive. Power consumption and price are likely the new EPX's best aspects, but Lite-On hasn't disclosed those numbers. A consumer-oriented version of this drive—shortened to the M.2 2280 form factor by the removal of power loss protection capacitors and equipped with client-oriented firmware—has not been announced but will likely show up in a few months or at CES2018 as the successor to Plextor's M8Pe or M8Se.", "Next, Lite-On had an EP-series prototype with two significant changes from the EPX. This prototype featured Marvell's new 88SS1092 Eldora Plus controller, and it's the first use of this controller we've encountered. More interestingly, the prototype was equipped with Toshiba's 3D NAND packaged using through-silicon vias (TSVs) instead of traditional wire bonding. Toshiba announced this flash memory last year and showed a die at FMS 2016, but we haven't heard much about this line of R&D recently. Most SSDs—especially M.2 SSDs—need to stack several NAND flash dies in each package in order to reach acceptable capacities. Stacking NAND dies with TSVs gives a higher quality connection between the dies than wire bonding, which allows for faster or lower-power communication between the NAND and the SSD controller, and potentially also for taller die stacks.", "Lite-On has verified Toshiba's claims by measuring a 20% power reduction and 30% performance improvement for their SSD equipped with TSV flash. Products from Lite-On using TSV flash could appear as early as this year given how substantial the power and performance benefits seem to be, but it is not clear how the cost and manufacturing volume of the TSV flash compares to the mainstream dies intended for traditional packaging. Toshiba is the only NAND flash manufacturer that has talked much about using TSVs, and they appear to have a substantial lead in incorporating TSV packaging into their NAND flash. This could translate to a significant advantage for Toshiba in a year or two when SSD vendors are planning how to make multi-TB M.2 SSDs capable of PCIe 4 speeds.", "Lite-On is continuing their collaboration with controller designer CNEX Labs to develop the Open Channel SSD concept and bring it to market. An open channel SSD allows the host system to bypass the traditional flash translation layer (FTL) and directly manage the allocation of the underlying flash memory. Moving most of the FTL from the SSD to the host system's CPU means the drivers running on the host have to be a lot more complex, but this arrangement brings substantial opportunities for optimization because the OS and applications can better cooperate with the FTL. Lite-On's AD2 SSD is a M.2 PCIe SSD using the CNEX Westlake+ controller to implement an open channel SSD using the LightNVM architecture, which extends the NVMe protocol. LightNVM support is built in to recent versions of the Linux kernel and NVMe tools, so the market might be ready for broader availability of open channel SSD hardware than CNEX's development kits. The long-term prospects for the LightNVM open channel SSD approach are not clear: the NVMe standard has been gradually adding support for application-level I/O hints and instructions to enable many of the same performance optimizations an open channel SSD is desirable for, and the increasingly popular NV-DIMM approach allows just as much low-level access as a LightNVM open channel SSD, but through a very different interface.", "The last drive Lite-On showed off was a prototype M.2 SSD using Microsemi's Flashtec NVMe2108 NVMe controller. Microsemi's Flashtec controller line (previously owned by IDT then PMC-Sierra) has been dominant among the largest high-end enterprise SSDs, with controllers offering up to 8 lanes of PCIe connectivity and 16 or 32 channel flash interfaces. The Flashtec NVMe2108 is Microsemi's smallest SSD controller yet, and their first that is suitable for M.2 SSDs. The Flashtec NVMe2108 controller exists in a more mainstream market segment where Microsemi faces far more competition. The 8-channel flash interface on the NVMe2108 controller matches that of most NVMe controllers for M.2 and U.2 SSDs. Lite-On did not share detailed performance information about this drive, but they have achieved random read speeds of over 500k IOPS, which is the fastest that any user of this controller has achieved so far."]},

Using the same 16nm MLC but a cheaper Silicon Motion controller, the ", " continued to offer good performance for most purposes and was also the most power efficient SSD of its time.", "Later in 2015, the consumer SSD market began to rapidly switch over to TLC NAND: consumers wanted cheaper SSDs, but only Samsung had usable 3D NAND, so planar TLC was the way to increase capacity. Micron introduced the ", " in November 2015 as their first SSD to use TLC NAND. The BX200 successfully reduced price per GB, but sacrificed a great deal of performance and power efficiency in the process. The BX200's fate was sealed by drives like the ", " that used faster and cheaper SK Hynix TLC to undercut the BX200's pricing while offering somewhat better performance.", "Finally, in June 2016 Micron's 3D NAND was ready for mass market use, and the consumer SSD market's race to the bottom was put on hold. Micron introduced the ", " using a high-performance Marvell controller like previous MX series SSDs, but using the TLC variant of their 3D NAND rather than MLC. The MX300 thus was serving as successor to both the MX200 and BX200, and it has done the job well with good performance and far better power efficiency than any previous TLC SSD (even considering ", ").", "The main limitation of the Crucial MX300 stems from the odd capacity of Micron's 32-layer 3D TLC parts. The 32L TLC die is Micron's 32L 256Gb MLC operated as a TLC chip, yielding a capacity of 384Gb (48GB) per die. It is awkward to build SSDs with standard power of two capacities out of such chips, so Micron initially introduced the MX300 with a 750GB (768GB raw) capacity model. The rest of the MX300 lineup used capacities that were slightly above the standard sizes (eg. 525GB instead of 512GB), which still left the MX300 with more overprovisioning than a typical consumer SSD. The odd capacity effect is most pronounced with the smallest MX300, the 275GB model. Micron didn't go any smaller than that because a drive in the ballpark of 128GB would use only three TLC dies, wasting one of the four channels on most SATA SSD controllers.", "Micron's upcoming second generation 3D NAND parts are designed with TLC in mind as the primary use, and Micron will be producing both 256Gb and 512Gb parts. But this new 64-layer 3D NAND is still ramping up in production. Intel has shipped limited quantities in their 545s, but most of the early 64L NAND is going to the enterprise SSD market.", "That's where the new Crucial BX300 comes in. The BX300 brings MLC NAND back to the Crucial product line for the sake of making smaller capacity entry-level SSDs. The Crucial BX300 will be produced in capacities from 120GB to 480GB using Micron's 256Gb 32L 3D MLC. Micron is again using a Silicon Motion controller for the BX line, this time the SM2258. Micron has not opted to use the DRAMless SM2258XT variant and instead has equipped the BX200 with 256MB to 512MB of their own DDR3.", "On paper, the BX300 does not appear to be making any significant compromises to reach low price points. In some respects it is superior to the MX300, and it certainly seems like it will have lower profit margins for Micron. The BX300 may be the kind of product that only a vertically-integrated manufacturer like Micron can successfully bring to market in the midst of an industry-wide NAND shortage. ADATA uses the same controller and NAND in their SU900 and SX950 SSDs, but those are selling for significantly higher prices than the Crucial MX300, not lower. The BX300 may turn out to be a short-lived stopgap product to go after a segment of the market that the MX300 is ill-suited for. A replacement for both the MX300 and BX300 using 64L TLC will probably show up as soon as Micron can spare the NAND.

With the MX200, Micron experimented with using SLC caching on smaller capacities and had mixed success—peak performance was boosted a bit, but at the cost of creating more background work for the controller that hurt sustained workloads. For the Crucial BX300, Micron is using relatively small fixed-size SLC caches. Sequential performance and random write performance are rated the same across all three capacities, while random read performance is reduced a bit for the 240GB and is cut in half for the 120GB model. The rated write endurance numbers are probably chosen simply to be lower than the ostensibly higher-end MX300 model, rather than being based on actually lower expectations for drive lifetime. The MX300 does have lots of overprovisioning with which to reduce write amplification, but the BX300 has a reasonable amount too and the advantage of inherently higher endurance from using MLC instead of TLC.", "For this review, the our 480GB Crucial BX300 will primarily be compared against:"]},

The company indicated that it would sell all or a part of its Lexar business, but it clearly wanted to exit the market of inexpensive removable storage devices. The two companies did not disclose financial terms of the transaction, but it is likely that Micron will have to reveal the sum in its quarter results.", "Longsys is a large China-based supplier of NAND flash-based storage solutions that include everything from memory cards to SSDs and embedded storage. The company was established in 1999 and currently sells hundreds of millions of NAND flash-based products every year, primarily in China, but also in many other countries. The acquisition of Lexar enables Longsys to enter the U.S. market with products carrying a well-known brand and therefore increase its sales. Unlike Micron, Longsys believes in long-term growth of removable storage products because new types of devices emerge (such as drones).", "“Lexar has built a great brand name and our vision is to make it even greater,” said Huabo Cai, CEO of Longsys Electronics. “Existing customers can rest assured that the innovative solutions and excellent support that they have experienced from Lexar will continue. The mission to make Lexar the go-to brand for high-performance removable storage continues, and we will expand upon it to offer even more compelling solutions as the age of wireless and big-data impact the consumer storage markets.”", "What remains to be seen is whether Longsys intends to use the Lexar brand to market SSDs in the U.S., or only hopes to make memory cards, flash drives and embedded storage under the trademark. If the company decides to expand usage of the brand to SSDs, then it will compete against Micron using the latter’s NAND in the U.S., which would be an interesting turn of events."]},

The HP S700 and S700 Pro SSDs use Micron 3D TLC NAND and Silicon Motion controllers, but have undergone tuning and significant QA from HP in an effort to give them an edge over earlier drives from other vendors that are using the same basic formula.", "The S700 and S700 Pro both compete in the low-end SATA SSD market segment. The S700 Pro's closest relatives in the market are drives like the ADATA Ultimate SU800 that use the same 3D TLC and Silicon Motion's SM2258 controller. The S700 instead uses the Silicon Motion SM2258XT DRAMless controller, and is the first retail DRAMless SSD we've tested in quite a while. Earlier this year we previewed Maxiotek's MK8115 DRAMless SSD controller with both 3D MLC and 3D TLC, and the latter configuration has since come to market as ADATA's Ultimate SU700.", "Externally, the HP S700 and S700 Pro share the same minimalist case design with white labeling on matte black aluminum. Internally, the color scheme continues with black PCBs, and the differences between the S700 and the Pro become clear. The S700's PCB is half the size of the S700 Pro's PCB, due to the latter's use of external DRAM, the larger controller package necessary to accommodate the DRAM interface, and the presence of twice as many pads for NAND packages to make the 1TB S700 Pro possible. The controllers are branded with the HP logo, but the printing on the PCBs gives away the Silicon Motion models inside. Neither circuit board has space allocated for power loss protection capacitors, indicating that HP doesn't plan to re-use these designs for any enterprise products. Thermal pads are included on top of the controllers and on the back side of the PCB near the controllers, but there are no pads on the NAND or DRAM.", "The 120GB S700 and the 128GB S700 Pro are each equipped with three NAND packages containing a single 384Gb (48GB) Micron 32-layer 3D TLC die. The larger capacities of the S700 Pro use a mix of single-die packages and dual-die packages (two of each on the 256GB, and four of each on the 512GB). The higher capacities of the S700 instead use non-standard triple die packages that—combined with the lack of external DRAM—allows for a much smaller PCB. Since the SM2258 controller and its DRAMless SM2258XT sibling have a four-channel NAND flash interface, both the S700 120GB and the S700 Pro 128GB are operating with only three out of four channels active. The larger models can use all four channels but don't have the same amount of flash on each each of the four channels. These unbalanced configurations are a result of the drives trying to offer traditional capacities while using a TLC die whose capacity is not a power of two. Intel and Micron have addressed this awkwardness with their second generation of 3D NAND by designing it with TLC in mind as the primary use case, leading them to manufacture 256Gb and 512Gb TLC dies.", "Interestingly, the dual-die packages on our 256GB S700 Pro sample carry a higher speed rating than the dual-die packages on our 512GB S700 Pro sample, but this is unlikely to affect performance since the single-die packages on both carry a lower speed rating than either type of dual-die package. Likewise, the DRAM parts are different across the S700 Pro lineup: our 128GB and 256GB samples are both equipped with 256MB of DDR3-1866 rated for 1.5V operation, while the 512GB sample has 512MB of DDR3-1600 rated for 1.35V. These discrepancies probably reflect the supply constraints in the NAND and DRAM markets and these minor details may change over the course of the SSDs' production run.", "The S700 has the same amount of flash memory as the S700 Pro but offers lower usable capacities. This extra overprovisioning can help mitigate some of the performance penalties of using a DRAMless controller, but the bigger benefit is probably that it helps keep the write endurance ratings up in spite of the higher write amplification factor that DRAMless drives are typically vulnerable to.", "The primary points of comparison for this review are other SATA SSDs using 3D NAND. The HP S700 is at a disadvantage as the only DRAMless TLC product in our collection. Not having a DRAM cache for the NAND mapping tables is usually a serious handicap for SATA SSDs, and the impact is only worse for TLC SSDs where the controller also has to manage an SLC write cache. Many of the major SSD brands in the North American market don't have any DRAMless models, or have only used DRAMless controllers with MLC NAND.", "The HP S700 Pro is more on par with the entry-level SATA SSDs from most brands. The combination of the SM2258 controller and Micron 3D NAND has been extremely popular this year, and has replaced the combination of a Phison controller and Toshiba planar TLC as the most commonly chosen turnkey solution for brands seeking to sell SSDs with a minimum of in-house engineering effort.", "The few vendors that do use DRAMless controllers in their entry-level SSDs are usually much less interested in sampling those products than their higher-performance drives, and hardly anyone wants to sample the lowest capacities that offer the lowest performance. Many brands have ceased offering capacities below 240GB on newer models to avoid the performance limitations of using a small number modern high-capacity NAND parts in a low-capacity drive, though the NAND shortage that has been driving prices up all year has led a few brands to re-introduce 120GB models.

Changing components like this without renaming the product can be controversial, but Samsung took the reasonable route of discontinuing the 128GB 850 PRO and 120GB 850 EVO. It was their hope that the 120GB capacity class would be rendered mostly obsolete by the price/GB improvements enabled by denser 3D NAND.", "When Samsung's 48L 3D NAND initially failed to reach its production or price targets, it became clear that Samsung still needed an affordable 120GB-class drive in its retail lineup. The 750 EVO was introduced to fill that gap, using 16nm TLC but retaining the same top-notch SSD controller from the 850 series. The 750 EVO initially debuted with 120GB and 250GB capacities, but a 500GB version was added as SSD prices began to rise across the industry due to a global shortage of NAND flash memory. (The disappointments of Samsung's 48L 3D NAND were one of the major supply-side factors leading to the shortage, but insatiable demand for SSDs and the difficulties everyone else had bringing any kind of 3D NAND to market were also very important contributors.) By the end of 2016, SSD prices were still rising but Samsung quietly discontinued the 750 EVO, again leaving them with a gap at the smallest end of the capacity range.", "The Samsung SSD 850 120GB is a product that Samsung never wanted to release, and it may even never see a global release. The fundamental challenge of offering 850 EVO-class performance on a drive with just four NAND flash dies hasn't gone away. Samsung's 64L 3D NAND is claimed to be a bit faster than the 48L NAND for writes, and power consumption is supposed to be lower for both reads and writes. This won't do much to offset the effects of limited parallelism with only four NAND dies.", "Like the 750 EVO, the Samsung SSD 850 120GB inherits all the 850 EVO's features like TCG Opal support thanks to using the same controller, but the 850 120GB's three year warranty is shorter than the five years on the 850 EVOs. The write endurance is thankfully on par with or better than the old 120GB 850 EVO (Samsung China's site is inconsistent about this specification), whereas the 750 EVO had less than half the write endurance. The only performance specification where the 850 120GB is slower than the old 850 EVO 120GB is for random reads at QD32, where it has lost 25% of the peak performance. However, performance numbers on the box like these do not tell the whole story.", "The Samsung S4LN062X01 MGX controller in the 850 120GB is old news. After three years on the market in the 850 EVO and related OEM and enterprise SSDs, it's still one of the top SATA SSD controllers with all the expected features and great performance and power management.", "While the 750 EVO put the controller and DRAM in the same BGA package, the 850 uses the original controller packaging with the DRAM next to it on the circuit board. The Samsung SSD 850 120GB uses the same PCB as current 850 EVOs up to 500GB, with one of the two NAND package spots populated, and the case is Samsung's standard matte black metal secured with three pentalobe screws.", "Samsung's NAND flash part numbers don't directly encode the manufacturing process used. The sole NAND package on the 850 120GB is marked K9CKGY8H5A. The CKG portion identifies this as a TLC package with four dies and a total capacity of 128GB, implying the use of 256Gb (32GB) dies. The A at the end of the part number designates this as Samsung's second generation of 256Gb TLC parts. The first generation of 256Gb TLC dies from Samsung was manufactured with their 48-layer V-NAND process, making this new part their 64-layer design. When Samsung gets around to shipping their 512Gb 64L TLC dies, they'll be marked with a M at the end of the part number because they are Samsung's first generation 512Gb TLC parts.", "This isn't our first encounter with Samsung's 64-layer fourth-generation 3D NAND. The Samsung Portable SSD T5 launched earlier this year as the first product to feature the 64L TLC V-NAND. Samsung used a portable SSD as the trial run for their preceding 48-layer 3D NAND as well, followed by a gradual migration of the rest of the product line. Samsung hasn't stated whether they plan to migrate the 850 EVO line over to 64L TLC in the same manner as they transitioned it from 32L to 48L, but I suspect they will. SATA SSDs aren't going away any time soon, and the current 850 EVOs are already competitive with the 64L 3D TLC SSDs from Western Digital/SanDisk and Intel. Updating the 850 EVO with 64L 3D TLC won't hurt the small capacity models because the capacity per die remains 256Gb.", "The future of the 850 PRO line and MLC drives in general is less clear. Samsung has said nothing about 64L MLC and even their enterprise SSDs are all on TLC now (except for the Z-NAND based SZ985). The 850 PRO has very little reason to continue existing now that NVMe drives are the high-performance option, so Samsung may end up discontinuing it and simplifying their retail SATA line to just a range of TLC-based 850s, starting with this 120GB model. In the NVMe space they will probably keep a MLC model around for enthusiasts unless their next generation of TLC-based NVMe SSDs can deliver huge performance increases. We expect Samsung to officially disclose some of their plans early next year, either at CES or shortly thereafter.", "There isn't much competition in the 120GB capacity class of SSDs. Other manufacturers have also largely abandoned this segment as they transition to 3D NAND with per-die capacities of 256Gb and larger. The only recent SSDs we have to compare against are a few drives using Micron's 384Gb 32L 3D TLC NAND. The first two, the ", " and the ", ", pair that Micron NAND with the Silicon Motion SM2258 controller, while the other member of the set is the HP S700, which adopts the DRAMless SM2258XT controller.

Micron used their 3D MLC for this model specifically designed to perform well at low capacities, but then they only sampled us the largest size to test. The 120GB BX300 is currently priced very well for a 120GB drive even before taking into account that it uses 3D MLC instead of TLC. It's also readily available for purchase in most markets.

For example, the 960 Pro is almost identical to the SM961, and the 950 Pro is based on the same controller found in the SM951. The 971 client series was for BGA SSDs, so for the next generation consumer drives, Samsung is expected to use the PM981 controller and NAND as a base for the design. Luckily, the PM981 is the subject of this review.", "The Samsung PM981 is Samsung's fourth-generation client PCIe SSD, based on the Phoenix controller and 64-layer V-NAND - both of which have yet to show up in Samsung's retail NVMe SSDs.

With roughly the same package size as the previous generation Samsung Polaris controller, the Phoenix likely retains the same basic configuration of PCIe lanes and NAND and DRAM channels. When Samsung announces retail products based on this controller we should be able to get some information about what's changed internally to allow for improved performance, but for now, even with our testing, we can only speculate. It is clear that Samsung is taking cooling more seriously this time around with a metal heatspreader on top of the package, similar to what i's used on the Silicon Motion SM2260 controller. Samsung has previously used copper foil in the drive stickers to help dissipate heat, so this marks a step up in attempting to cool the controller. Other M.2 PCIe SSD vendors have used that tactic and many have also released drives with more substantial heatspreaders or heatsinks in the future.", "The 64-layer 3D TLC NAND Samsung uses in the PM981 has been gradually rolling out across their product lines this year, starting with the ", ". Earlier this week we took a look at the ", ", a new model SATA drive that has been released in the Asian market.

The 512GB model uses 8-high stacks and is about 0.4mm thinner as a result. The model number stenciled in the circuit board indicates that Samsung does not plan to use this layout for anything larger than 1TB, so if a 2TB model shows up it will probably use a denser layout of four packages rather than switch to 512Gb NAND dies.", "Samsung's OEM client PCIe SSDs are usually not an exact match for the retail products of the same generation. Their first-generation XP941 used a PCIe 2.0 interface with AHCI instead of NVMe, and never got a retail counterpart. The SM951 and PM951 used planar MLC and TLC respectively, while the later 950 PRO used Samsung's 3D MLC NAND. The SM961 also seems to use planar MLC for its smaller capacities, though the TLC-based PM961 is entirely based on 3D NAND. The Samsung PM971 is an entry-level BGA SSD that may not get a retail counterpart, and if it does it will not fit into either of the existing 9x0 PRO/EVO product tiers.", "Based on the model number, the PM981 could be expected to serve as a preview of a 980 EVO product. However, every SSD Samsung has moved to 64-layer V-NAND has used TLC—even the high-end enterprise SSDs. With Samsung's Z-NAND covering the high-performance low-latency niche, Samsung may retire the use of MLC NAND from their more mainstream product lines. If Samsung is not planning to release an enthusiast-oriented Z-NAND product, then the PM981's retail counterpart may have to serve as successor to both the 960 EVO and 960 PRO.", "For this review, the primary comparisons will be against the Samsung 960 PRO and 960 EVO, the closest retail equivalents to Samsung's previous generation of client PCIe SSDs.

IMFT started with 72nm planar NAND shortly before SSDs started going mainstream, and for most of its history the partnership has been one of just four major NAND flash manufacturers. The partnership has covered just the memory technology and manufacturing, with Intel and Micron separately developing SSDs based on the shared flash technology, or selling the memory on the open market.", "The upcoming split is not without precedent. In 2012, Intel sold its share of some IMFT fabs to Micron, leaving just the original Lehi, Utah facilities as co-owned. Since then, both Intel and Micron have each established more of their own manufacturing facilities, but the R&D has still been a joint effort centered around the Utah facilities. Intel declined to invest in the final 16nm planar NAND node, leaving that generation entirely to Micron while their first generation 3D NAND was in development.", "Intel and Micron have very different priorities for their NAND flash business. Intel almost exclusively uses their NAND in their own SSDs, while Micron is both a major vendor of SSDs and supplier of raw NAND flash. Intel focuses primarily on the enterprise market while outsourcing controller development for most of their recent consumer SSDs, and they even bought SK Hynix 16nm NAND for some client and consumer SSDs when their decision to skip the 16nm IMFT node left them with no cost-competitive flash until their 3D NAND was ready. Micron has shown growing interest in the mobile market with their much-touted 59mm^2 256Gbit 64-layer 3D TLC part, while Intel historically has tended to favor outfitting its enterprise SSDs with much larger flash dies that are inconvenient to squeeze into a smartphone.", "These differences have not previously been strong enough motivation to entirely dissolve the partnership. However, upcoming engineering challenges may be prompting Intel and Micron to seek drastically different strategies for future generations of flash memory. Intel and Micron are currently rolling out their second generation 64-layer 3D NAND, while finishing development on their third generation, most likely a 96-layer design. Increasing the layer count into the triple digit range may require string stacking to be adopted in the next generation or two, and Intel and Micron might be disagreeing about when to make that switch in manufacturing methods. There is also a possibility that one of the parties may want to switch from their 3D floating gate cell architecture to a charge trap cell design more like that used by Samsung and everyone else in the 3D NAND game. Such a move would be a huge change in strategy for either company and also something of an admission of defeat—a sign that their decision to stick with a floating gate cell through the 2D to 3D transition was starting to be a handicap. But so far, neither company has given any indication of a technological change in direction, and it will be a few years before any such change could be implemented and judged against the approach taken by the other partner.

Now ASRock is joining the market.", "There is nothing too complex on an M.2 PCIe add-in card: the PCIe lanes on the slot finger go directly to the drives in question. As long as there is sufficient power, and sufficient cooling, there is not much more to it than that. ASRock’s card positions the M.2 drives at a 45-degree angle, provides a PCIe 6-pin for power, uses its metallic shroud for additional heatsink cooling, and then puts in a fan to direct airflow out of the exhaust. This is a variable speed fan that reacts to a thermal sensor, so will speed up if the case is warm. If you wanted overkill M.2 cooling, this is it.", "There is another feature that ASRock has had to put on the card, for anyone that wants to put more than one of these Ultra Quad M.2 PCIe Cards into the system. A series of four DIP switches are on the PCB which enables ASRock’s software and the system to determine which is the first Quad M.2 PCIe card, which is the second, and so on. Otherwise enumeration of drives in certain situations might not be guaranteed.", "ASRock lists the add-in card as having support for Intel’s VROC technology, although that requires Intel PCIe SSDs in order to function as well as the VROC module.

It was unclear which model of PCIe switch was being used due to the heatsinks, however I would suspect that these were PLX9000 series (probably 9290 models) which are not cheap. We were told that a fully kitted out server would have a ‘list’ price (note, this is a product specifically for Samsung) of around $250,000. It is half-surprising that the drives are not Samsung, though.", "So despite being in awe for a couple of minutes, my amazement at seeing an ‘M.3’ drive was short lived.

Obviously, the DCU1000 cannot hit anything higher than 3.8-3.9 GB/s with sequential reads due to PCIe 3.0 x4 limitation even in RAID 0, as any other U.2 drive. Meanwhile, Kingston advertises an aggregated read speed of 30 GB/s and an aggregated write speed of up to 27 GB/s for a 1U box containing 10 DCU1000 drives. As for random read reads, Kingston indicates that the box is capable 7M/6.6M read/write 4K IOPS (presumably at high queue depths).", "While the Kingston DCU1000 can potentially offer a rather high aggregated performance, its capacity of 3.2 TB may be insufficient for certain mixed-use environments.

Kingston will be among the first well-known brands to use M.2 drives for a server-grade U.2 SSD. The architecture has its pros and cons. On the one hand, Kingston does not need to use enterprise-grade SSD controllers and procure huge amounts of enterprise-grade NAND flash specifically for server drives (that may sit in stock for a while). Besides, it can relatively quickly start using different drives (with proper firmware) with the DCU1000 backplane. On the other hand, enterprise controllers have a feature set that is better suited for datacenter environments and the PEX 8725 switch most probably eats most, if not all, the savings that Kingston gets by not using an enterprise-grade SSD controller.", "The reason for designing such a drive, using a PCIe switch and M.2 drives, comes down to its intended use cases. U.2 drives are hot-swap, and being behind a PCIe switch allows the M.2 drives to also gain that functionality. The use-case presented to us in our briefing was one for video editing, where a film studio has a server/machine full of these drives, and when a days recording is done, the drives can be packed up and shipped to a visual effects studio (either by courier, or by placing an intern on a flight) to do their magic. This is commonly ", ", and offers much better bandwidth than transferring the raw 8K/16K footage through fat internet pipes. (Big data center services, like Google/Amazon, literally ship petabytes of data around using couriers, as the overall bandwidth is quicker.) The key to doing this is a combination of featureset (hotswappable, power loss protection) and storage density. While the first drives available will be in the 3.2 TB range, Kingston are ready and waiting to move forward with a 6.4 TB version when the M.2 drives double in capacity. One minute of uncompressed 16-bit 8K video comes in 284 GB, so the higher the capacity, the better. Having good speed and good random performance helps as well.", "The KC1000 will be available to select customers of Kingston in the coming months.

Most of the competing 64L TLC SSDs in the consumer market are still using 256Gb dies for some or all models, in order to avoid the performance limitations that usually result when there are too few dies to access in parallel.", "The controller on the 860 EVO and 860 PRO is the Samsung MJX, latest in a long line of successful SATA SSD controllers. Samsung hasn't provided much information about what this generation brings to the table, but one clear highlight is support for LPDDR4 DRAM. This is probably the primary source of the large power savings we've observed from the 860 series, and it is particularly welcome for the high-capacity models that includes multiple GB of DRAM.", "  ", " ", "Our Samsung 860 EVO sample for today is the 2TB model in the M.2 SATA form factor. This is the largest M.2 capacity available, though the 2.5 models go up to 4TB. Samsung has managed to make this a single-sided M.2 drive, which is preferred for the broadest compatibility with thin ultrabooks. Thanks to the large per-die capacity and the small size of their SATA controller, Samsung had a much easier time squeezing 2TB onto this drive than they did with the MLC-based 960 PRO NVMe drive. For the 960 PRO product, Samsung had to package the the drive's DRAM stacked on top of the controller in order to have room for four NAND packages; the 2TB 860 EVO M.2 instead uses just two NAND packages, each containing 16 dies.", "For this review we must point out that it is unusual for us to receive review samples of a M.2 SATA SSD, instead of the larger 2.5 version. The smaller form factor offers the same performance and features, but required us to take a slightly different approach to power measurements. For this review, a 2.5 SATA to M.2 converter board was used. This board's main task is to step the 5V power supply down to the 3.3V used for M.2 SSDs. Some power is wasted in this conversion, so the 860 EVO has a slight handicap in our power and efficiency measurements.", "2TB is still quite large for a consumer SSD, and many product lines do not include models this large. 64-layer 3D NAND is also still almost exclusive to the vertically integrated brands that manufacture NAND. These factors mean the 2TB 860 EVO has very few direct competitors. The Crucial MX500 and the WD Blue 3D NAND aka SanDisk Ultra 3D are the only other mainstream 64L TLC SATA drives. We haven't tested the 2TB models from either of those product lines, so this review includes results from the 1TB models. Generally speaking, larger SSDs are faster, but we've seen several cases where multi-TB drives are a bit slower than their 1TB counterparts, so the 1TB models included in this review are not at a clear disadvantage due to their capacity.", "For several generations, the SATA SSD market has only been able to offer small incremental performance improvements. Faster NAND and better controllers can't get around the 6Gbps SATA speed limit, so drives have to differentiate themselves with performance at low queue depths, and with power efficiency. The Samsung 860 PRO set several performance records, but for the most part those don't translate into a noticeable difference for most consumer workloads. However, the 860 PRO did greatly improve power efficiency, and it no longer appears to be necessary to sacrifice efficiency to reach the highest levels of performance possible from a SATA SSD.", "The new Samsung 860 EVO drives, like the one in this review, get the same controller and DRAM updates as the 860 PRO, but historically TLC-based drives tend to be less power efficient than MLC-based drives. With stiffer competition from Crucial and WD/SanDisk, the 860 EVO will have a tough time standing out as a faster TLC option than anything else—a position that the 850 EVO held securely for most of its time on the market. The 860 EVO needs to match the 860 PRO's power efficiency improvements and deliver at least some performance improvement in order to attain the same unrivaled best-in-class status that the 850 EVO enjoyed.", "Most of the industry is using 64-layer 3D NAND flash memory this year—the first time since Samsung's introduction of 3D NAND that they've faced competition that is so close on paper. For most of its long life in the market, the Samsung 850 EVO was unchallenged as the best TLC-based SATA SSD. At times it was able to command a substantial price premium over any other TLC drive and over many MLC drives. That started to change last year, when Intel, Micron, Toshiba and WD/SanDisk beat Samsung to market with 64-layer 3D NAND. Most of Samsung's competitors now have mature high-quality 3D NAND shipping in volume, so Samsung is competing on a fairly level playing field with this generation."]},

With the Optane SSD DC P4800X now covering the highest product segment, Intel's flash-based enterprise NVMe drives are now divided into just two performance and endurance tiers. The P4510 falls into the cheaper tier of drives with much lower write performance and write endurance ratings that are generally between 0.5 drive writes per day (DWPD) and 1 DWPD. The DC P46xx tier has write endurance ratings around 3 DWPD (and the Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for 30 DWPD).", "Intel regards the P45xx tier of products as intended for high-capacity primary storage usage, while the P46xx drives are targeted for use as a cache layer.

With those performance increases and the reduced power consumption, the Intel claims the P4510 offers twice the performance per watt on some workloads.", "Intel has also tuned the P4501's firmware to offer much better quality of service. A major part of this is that the P4510 is better about prioritizing read operations over flash program or erase operations, leading to an order of magnitude improvement in 99.99th percentile read latency. The P4510 also benefits from the 64L 3D TLC's flash program latency, which is about half that of Intel's 32L 3D NAND.", "While today marks the first official announcement of the P4510, the 1TB and 2TB capacities started shipping to some large cloud providers in 2017. New today are the 4TB and 8TB models, and the full line will be more broadly available starting this quarter. With a broad range of capacities, and lower prices and higher performance enabled by the transition to 64L 3D NAND, Intel is expecting the P4510 to be their best-selling SSD this year. For now, the P4510 is only available as a 2.5 U.2 drive, but in the future Intel may introduce other form factors, including EDSFF—the now-standardized version of the Intel Ruler concept.", "We have only had a few days to play with the Intel SSD DC P4510 and Intel VROC, so the benchmark results in this review are very limited. This review focuses solely on the performance of the P4510 and the scalability limits of Intel VROC. Follow-up reviews will provide our usual in-depth analysis of single-drive performance and power efficiency as compared against other enterprise NVMe SSDs, compare VROC performance between Windows and Linux, and VROC performance with an Optane cache.

Likewise, the workloads represented by the ATSB Destroyer and Heavy tests don't actually fit on such small drives. The small drives still perform the same volume of reads and writes, but the block addresses in the I/O trace that are beyond the capacity of the drive are wrapped around to fit.

However, it is clear that the TLC-based EVO is the more important product for Samsung. The PRO series has been reduced back down to just two capacities (512GB and 1TB), while the EVO now spans from 250GB up to 2TB. The EVO series now also matches the PRO's 5-year warranty term. Other manufacturers have started to abandon MLC NAND completely for their consumer product lines. Samsung isn't quite there yet, but the PRO is looking like even more of a niche product this time around.

Second, the rated write endurance of the 970 PRO is twice that of the EVO, going from just over 0.3 Drive Writes Per Day to 0.6 DWPD.

This means that Samsung's 970 PRO will have very little direct competition and the 970 EVO will be facing off against the flagship SSDs from most other brands. To better match the flagship products the 970 EVO will compete against, the warranty has been lengthened from 3 years to 5 years and write endurance ratings have increased by 50%.

Similar to the last generation, Samsung offered a 2TB model, but from the PRO line - that option has been dropped this time around in favor of the much cheaper EVO version for a 2TB TLC drive. That 2TB model will be the only 970 EVO model to use Samsung's larger 512Gb 64L TLC die, while the smaller drives use the 256Gb die. This prevents the smaller models from suffering the performance penalties that come with the reduced parallelism of having fewer NAND flash chips on the drive. The 512Gb die also enables Samsung to easily fit 2TB onto a single-sided M.2 2280 card without resorting to the expensive DRAM on controller chip stacking that was necessary with the 2TB 960 PRO.", "The Samsung Phoenix controller introduces a nickel-coated heatspreader, and the 970 EVO retains the copper foil layer in the label on the back of the drive that was introduced with the 960 generation, but there are no more serious cooling measures on the drive.

The new Optane Memory M10 brings a 64GB capacity to the product line that launched a year ago with 16GB and 32GB options.", "The complete Optane Memory caching solution consists of an M.2 SSD plus Intel's drivers for caching on Windows, and firmware support on recent motherboards for booting from a cached volume. Intel launched Optane Memory with its Kaby Lake generation of processors and chipsets, and this generation is intended to complement Coffee Lake systems. However, all of the new functionality works just as well on existing Kaby Lake systems as with Coffee Lake.", "The major new user-visible feature for this generation of Optane Memory caching is the addition of the ability to cache a secondary data drive, whereas previously only boot drives were possible. Intel refers to this mode as data drive acceleration, compared to the system acceleration (boot drive) that was the only mode supported by the first generation of Optane Memory. Data drive acceleration has been added solely through changes to the Optane Memory drivers for Windows, and this feature was actually quietly rolled out with version 16 of Intel's RST drivers back in February.", "Also earlier this year, Intel launched the Optane SSD 800P family as the low-end alternative to the flagship Optane SSD 900P. The 800P and the new Optane Memory M10 are based on the same hardware and an updated revision of the original Optane Memory M.2 modules. The M10 and the 800P use the same controller and the same firmware. The 800P is usable as a cache device with the Optane Memory software, and the Optane Memory M10 and its predecessor are usable as plain NVMe SSDs without caching software. The 800P and the M10 differ only in branding and intended use; the drive branded as the 58GB 800P is functionally identical to the 64GB M10 and both have the exact same usable capacity of 58,977,157,120 bytes.", "Everything said about the 58GB Optane SSD 800P in our review of the 800P family applies equally to the 64GB Optane Memory M10. Intel hasn't actually posted official specs for the M10, so we'll just repeat the 800P specs here:", "Rather than cover exactly the same territory as our review of the 800P, this review is specifically focused on use of the Optane Memory M10 as a cache drive in front of a mechanical hard drive. Thanks to the addition of the data drive acceleration functionality, we can use much more of our usual benchmark suite for this than we could with last year's Optane Memory review. The data drive acceleration mode also broadens the potential market for Optane Memory, to include users who want to use a NAND flash-based SSD as their primary storage device but also need a more affordable bulk storage drive. The combination of a 64GB Optane Memory M10 (at MSRP) and a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive is about the same price as a 1TB SATA SSD with 3D TLC NAND, and at higher capacities the combination of a hard drive plus Optane Memory is much cheaper than a SATA SSD.", "Intel's Optane Memory system works as an inclusive cache: adding an Optane Memory cache to a system does not increase the usable storage capacity, it just improves performance. Data written to the cache will also be written to the backing device, but applications don't have to wait for the data to land on both devices.", "Once enabled, there is no need or option for manual tuning of cache behavior. The operation of the cache system is almost entirely opaque to the user. After an unclean shutdown, there is a bit of diagnostic information visible as the cache state is reconstructed, but this process usually seems to only take a second or two before the OS continues to load.", "Intel's Optane Memory caching drivers require a Kaby Lake or newer processor and chipset, but our primary consumer SSD testbed is still a Skylake-based machine. For last year's Optane Memory review, Intel delivered the 32GB module pre-installed in a Kaby Lake desktop. This time around, Intel provided a Coffee Lake system. Both of those systems have been used for tests in this review, and a few benchmarks of drives in a non-caching role have been performed on our usual SSD testbed."]},

This will join the TLC-based ", " as a lower-cost tier with reduced write performance and endurance.", "QLC NAND flash memory stores four bits of data per memory cell, providing a 33% capacity boost over three bit per cell TLC NAND, which is now used in almost all SSDs. The downsides are that QLC NAND has lower write endurance on the order of 1000 program/erase cycles, and lower write performance. Both of these are consequences of the difficulty of discriminating between 16 possible voltage levels within a memory cell, as compared to the 8 voltage levels required to store three bits per cell.", "The cost reduction brought by QLC NAND is a much-awaited advance for enterprise storage. Most NAND flash manufacturers have started sampling QLC NAND within the past year, generally built on the same 64-layer 3D NAND processes that current-generation TLC NAND uses. Micron has previously shown wafers of 512Gb 64-layer QLC when ", ", but today they are also announcing a 1Tb 64L QLC part—the first 1Tb memory chip to hit commercial availability. That 1Tb part is organized as four planes that can be processing I/O commands in parallel, compared to two planes for previous Intel/Micron NAND parts. This helps offset most of the performance loss associated with increasing per-die capacity. Thanks to the CMOS under the array design of Intel/Micron 3D NAND, the extra peripheral circuitry requried by doubling the number of planes doesn't add much to the overall die size.", "It was initially feared that QLC write endurance would be low enough that drives would need to be treated more or less as write-once, read-many (WORM) devices, requiring careful handling on the software side. With multiple manufacturers now rating their QLC NAND for around 1k P/E cycles, it is clear that QLC-based SSDs aren't too fragile and can handle many existing workloads without needing major software changes to reduce writes.", "Micron is primarily marketing the 5210 ION SSDs as replacement for hard drives, rather than replacements for any existing tier of enterprise SSD products. In this role, the 5210 ION will have clear advantages in density (with 2-8TB per 2.5 drive) and performance. QLC NAND only provides incremental improvements to cost, so the 5210 ION won't be matching 7200RPM hard drives for price per GB, but 10k RPM drives will probably be feeling the pressure, especially from TCO calculations that take into account the power efficiency advantages of SSDs.", "Micron isn't providing detailed specifications for the 5210 ION series at this time, but we can read between the lines. The 5210 ION series is based on the same controller and firmware platform used for the 5200 and 5100 families. That means a Marvell 88SS1074 controller, and Micron-written firmware with features like their FlexCapacity configurable overprovisioning to trade capacity for performance and endurance.", "Specific performance numbers haven't been disclosed, but Micron has indicated that both random and sequential read performance will be comparable to the 5200 family—meaning the 5210 can saturate the SATA link at higher queue depths. Write performance will be lower than the 5200 ECO but still higher than what a hard drive can deliver, especially for random writes.", "The most important question is what the write endurance of the new QLC-based SSDs will be. The 5210 ION's endurance rating will be less than that of the 5200 ECO, which is rated for around 1 DWPD in most capacities. Micron indicates that their QLC NAND is good for around 1k Program/Erase cycles, which suggests a limit of at most about 0.5 DWPD before write amplification is taken into account. This is still higher than many consumer SSDs, where 0.3 DWPD is a typical rating for entry-level SATA SSDs with 3D TLC NAND.", "When used for tasks where the performance of hard drives is currently adequate, the write endurance of the 5210 ION shouldn't be much of a problem. An endurance rating of about 0.1 DWPD would be sufficient for the 5210 ION to handle more random writes over its 5-year warranty than a hard drive can provide, but for sequential workloads it will still be possible to wear out the 5210 by writing to it at hard drive speeds. But Micron isn't recommending the 5210 ION for continuous video recording; instead they are pitching it for workloads that are at least 90% reads.", "The Micron 5210 ION is now shipping to select customers with capacities from 1.92TB to 7.68TB, and will be broadly available this fall. Exact pricing and specifications will be released at that time. Intel has not yet announced any products using QLC NAND, but we expect product announcements and possibly shipments in time for Flash Memory Summit in August.", "Intel and Micron are also working on their next generation 3D NAND manufacturing process, which increases the layer count to 96. This will provide a bigger density boost than a switch from TLC to QLC. It appears that development is currently focused on 96L TLC parts of unspecified capacity, but they will surely be followed by 96L QLC parts as well.

The new client SSD controllers share a common architecture with Marvell's latest enterprise NVMe controllers, allowing vendors to share firmware code between product lines. All of these new controllers support both 3D TLC and 3D QLC NAND flash memory.", "The new 88SS1100 controller is the most direct replacement for the 88SS1093 Eldora controller, Marvell's most popular current NVMe controller. Both use a PCIe 3.0 x4 host interface and an 8-channel NAND interface. The 88SS1100 is very similar to the 88SS1098 enterprise controller that Marvell announced earlier this year, with the 88SS1100 lacking a few enterprise-oriented features like dual-port capability and high-capacity RAM support. The basic performance specs of the 88SS1100 are the same: up to 3.6GB/s for sequential reads, 3.0GB/s for sequential writes, 780k IOPS for random reads and 650k IOPS for random writes. Marvell's updated controller architecture enables this level of performance through a combination of an upgraded LDPC error correction engine, a faster NAND interface and an increase in the number of CPU cores.", "Marvell is also introducing the 88SS1084 as a low-end counterpart to the 88SS1100.

{"title": "Intel Previews M.2 Optane SSD 905P 380GB", "paragraph": ["During ", " at Computex 2018, Intel Client Computing Group manager Gregory Bryant offered a brief preview of the upcoming M.2 version of the Optane SSD 905P high-end NVMe SSD. Intel's Optane SSD lineup has been split between the high-performance, high-power drives in 2.5 U.2 and PCIe add-in card form factors, and the much lower-performance M.2 drives of the Optane Memory and Optane SSD 800P product lines. The existence of a ", " before the U.2 and AIC versions of the 905P were officially launched.", "At first glance, it would appear that the combination of Intel's high-end Optane SSD controller architecture and the more consumer-friendly M.2 form factor would be a welcome addition to the product family. However, this drive appears to be nearly identical to the enterprise ", " we spotted earlier this year at the Open Compute Project Summit. The only difference we can spot is that the drive shown at Computex appears to have a metal heatspreader over the SSD controller, but the presentation's images of the drive show the bare controller as exhibited at OCP Summit. This means that the M.2 Optane SSD 905P will use the 110mm long M.2 form factor generally used by enterprise M.2 drives, instead of the 80mm length used by almost all consumer M.2 drives. This extra length will prevent the M.2 Optane SSD 905P from being used in most notebook computers (though Intel claims the 905P M.2 will be suitable for mobile use), and will exclude it from many M.2 slots on desktop motherboards. Intel has mentioned using the 905P in quad-M.2 riser cards such as those sold by ASUS and ASRock. Those adapters allow high-end desktops to provide four PCIe lanes to each of four drives by enabling port bifurcation on one of their PCIe x16 slot, allowing for the best possible NVMe RAID performance.", "The M.2 form factor will present additional challenges in power delivery and heat removal. The M.2 slot only provides a 3.3V supply, and even the most power-hungry M.2 drives are limited to 2-2.5 A draw. The M.2 905P will be limited to about half to two thirds of the power draw of the 905Ps in larger form factors that include a 12V supply. Intel and Samsung have sought to work around this problem by introducing new M.2-like form factors for enterprise SSDs that add a 12V supply (and hot-swap capability), but they aren't backwards compatible and won't be showing up in the consumer market.", "Even when limited to 6-8W, the M.2 905P may have trouble with heat and its impact on performance. The primary performance advantages of Optane SSDs are their exceptional performance at low queue depths (thanks to the low latency of 3D XPoint memory compared to NAND flash memory), and the reliability of their high performance, which can be sustained more or less indefinitely since there are no SLC write caches to fill up and minimal garbage collection for the controller to perform under the hood. However, even with a heatspreader over the SSD controller, it is likely that sustained workloads will lead to thermal throttling unless the 905P is housed in a more substantial cooling system, such as the actively-cooled quad-M.2 adapters. Such throttling is also difficult to avoid for flash-based M.2 SSDs, but in general consumer storage workloads don't provide enough sustained I/O for throttling to be a concern. Optane SSDs are marketed precisely for the workloads that are an exception to that rule, so throttling will be harder to overlook.", "The M.2 version of the Intel Optane SSD 905P is stated as having a 380GB capacity, slightly different from the 375GB capacity used by the enterprise Optane P4800X and P4801X. It's not clear if the difference is due to the consumer drive using slightly less overprovisioning, or if it's another case of inconsistent unit definitions and rounding as in the case of the ", " vs the 58GB Optane SSD 800P. Decreased overprovisioning is certainly possible, because Intel is feeling more confident about the write endurance of the 3D XPoint memory used by Optane products, to the point that upcoming enterprise Optane SSDs will have double the write endurance rating of the current products despite still using the first-generation 3D XPoint memory parts. Even a flagship drive for the enthusiast consumer segment doesn't need to support 60 drive writes per day, so Intel should have some room to trade endurance for capacity while still offering the highest endurance in the consumer SSD market.", "Intel will officially launch the 380GB M.2 Optane SSD 905P later this summer, and will provide full specifications at that time."]},

On the other hand, HP’s Z Turbo Drives also rely on software RAID (albeit they are based on Samsung’s SSDs) and it looks like there are not a lot of complaints because of the RAID implementation.", "TEKQ says that the PCB for the next-gen Thunderbolt 3 storage device is ready (it does not disclose its branding or the TB3 controller it intends to use), so expect the company to produce appropriate drives for customers interested in capacity in the following months. Obviously, two SSDs will make the device a bit bigger, but it is not something that the target audience is primarily concerned about.

At Computex, AIC and Intel showcased the new ‘Grays Peak’ FB128-LX platform designed for high-density flash storage using this new ruler SSD.", "The ruler specification is based on Intel’s new ‘Enterprise and Datacenter SSD Form Factor’, known as EDSFF, which can enable each drive to have a PCIe 3.0 x4 or a PCIe 3.0 x8 connection to the system. The Grays Peak server in this instance uses a dual-socket Xeon combined with 36 of the new ruler SSDs, with the top variants aiming to provide 1 PB of storage into a 1U chassis by taking advantage of increased SSD length and optimal thermal environments. Current capacity puts 576 TB into 1U, giving 16 TB per drive.", "Obviously having 36 drives, even with a x4 connection (such as the mechanical sample on display), equates to 36x4 = 144 PCIe lanes, more than a dual socket server can handle, so managing in the middle are a pair of PLX 8000-series PCIe switches. The demo PCB above shows the bump layouts for them and we confirmed that the system is using 8000-series and not the newer 9000-series. The number of PCIe lanes from each CPU will be even more important in the future as the drives move up to x8 connection speeds.

Realtek introduced its first SSD controller two years ago targeting primarily entry-level PCIe drives. This controller has received a lukewarm welcome from makers of SSDs, which was not a surprise as the market is quite packed. As a result, the company changed strategy and its new RTS5762 and RTS5763DL controllers that are aimed at higher-performance models. Realtek demonstrated both products at Computex.", "The Realtek RTS5762 will be the company’s flagship controller designed for high-end SSDs. This chip is NVMe 1.3 compliant, features 8 flash channels and supports various types of 3D TLC and 3D QLC NAND flash memory, thus featuring robust LDPC-based ECC methods to ensure proper endurance for SSDs. Realtek does not want to disclose all the details about the RTS5762 and the RTS5763DL controllers just now, but one of the representatives for the company in its booth said that the said chips support up to 150 bits/1 KB ECC. Meanwhile, when asked about processing cores the controllers feature, the rep said that the company uses its own custom cores without elaborating.", "When it comes to performance, Realtek says that SSDs powered by the RTS5762 will deliver up to 3500 MB/s sequential read speeds as well as up to 3000 MB/s write speeds. To put it into perspective, Samsung’s flagship 970 PRO drive offers up to 3500 MB/s reads and up to 2700 MB/s writes (when pseudoSLC caching is used), based on official numbers (for real world numbers check out our ", "). It is unclear what kind of memory Realtek used to hit its targets, but at the show the company demonstrated an RTS5762-powered drive featuring Toshiba’s BICS3 64-layer 3D TLC NAND.", "In addition to the high-end controller, Realtek plans to offer a cheaper RTS5763DL controller aimed at lower-end SSDs without DRAM. This chip is also NVMe 1.3 compliant, has four NAND channels and, just like its bigger brother, also supports 3D TLC and 3D QLC memory. It is noteworthy that the RTS5763DL fully supports AES256 encryption (just like its bigger brother), which is a feature not often found with cheaper controllers.", "Despite being an inexpensive controller, the RTS5763DL comes with a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface and therefore has no bottlenecks on this side of things, unlike its predecessor. Sequential read speeds of drives based on the RTS5763DL come in at 2150 MB/s, whereas sequential write speeds come in at 1474 MB/s (when pSLC caching is used), which is more or less in line with Silicon Motion’s SM2263XT-powered drives. While these numbers may not impress if compared to those offered by the RTS5762 and other high-end models, it should be noted that today’s entry-level PCIe SSDs based on Realtek’s RTS5760 can barely hit 1000 MB/s, thus competing successfully only against SATA drives that top out at 560 MB/s.", "At present various makers of SSDs are evaluating Realtek’s controller solutions and if they find the new chips good enough, expect actual drives featuring the RTS5762 and RTS5763DL controllers to hit the market sometimes next year.

But at the booth at Computex, I bumped into a small add-in for current U.2 enabled servers.", "Each one of the NF1 drives is within its own bracket that can be removed easily from the drive, and the backplane of the U.2 conversion drive we were told lets the system see each drive as a separate drive in the system (U.2 is essentially PCIe, so as long as it can support the correct bifurcation modes). We were told that despite each NF1 drive being a PCIe 3.0 x4 drive, because U.2 only supports four lanes, each drive will be knocked down to a x2 drive.", "One interesting thing to note is that the traces from the adaptor are not simple straight lines: we saw curved traces like this previously with the first generations of Thunderbolt controllers several years ago.", "Obviously the combined U.2 drive is longer than a standard U.2 slot in a server, but AIC didn’t touch on how that issue was approached.

Keeping in mind that PNY specifically chose USB Type-C instead of Thunderbolt to maintain compatibility with Apple’s MacBooks and other ultra-thin laptops with 5 Gbps USB 3.0 connectors, 800 MB/s does not really seem as a major performance bottleneck of the drive.", "The manufacturer does not explicitly disclose what drive it uses is inside the Elite-X Portable SSD. Meanwhile considering the fact that PNY works closely with Phison, it is highly likely that the Elite-X Portable SSD uses a Phison PS5008-E8 controller as well as Toshiba’s BICS 3D NAND.", "Since the combination of Phison’s PS5008-E8 and Toshiba’s 3D NAND is relatively widespread in the industry, PNY will not have to spend a long time validating the work of the design.

We've previously reviewed that same basic combination in the ", " and found it to be the best drive yet for establishing the viability of the entry-level NVMe market segment.", "Kingston brings a few potential advantages to the table that MyDigitalSSD doesn't offer. Kingston is one of the largest fabless memory companies, and they buy DRAM and NAND flash by the wafer. They can perform their own binning and packaging, which gives them extra flexibility in choosing what grade of memory goes into which product line. Kingston also has very close technical and financial relationships with both Phison and Toshiba Memory.", "Even before running the benchmarks, there are several differences apparent between the Kingston A1000 and the MyDigitalSSD SBX. Both drives are clearly derived from the same reference design, but the A1000 seems to use an updated PCB layout with fewer unused pads for debugging (and a slightly different color). The A1000 also seems to feature a newer Kingston-specific firmware version, and it is configured to reserve a larger spare area than the SBX (hence the 480GB vs 512GB usable capacities). MyDigitalSSD and Kingston both give their E8 drives a 5-year warranty, but Kingston gives their drive a slightly lower write endurance rating and less optimistic performance specifications. Kingston is also not offering a 120GB-class capacity option with the A1000, instead starting the product line at 240GB.", "The Phison PS5008-E8 controller is one of their two second-generation NVMe SSD controllers. Phison's first NVMe controller was the PS5007-E7, which was used primarily with Toshiba 15nm MLC NAND flash in consumer SSDs and a few enterprise SSDs. Phison's second generation consists of the E8 and E12 controllers, splitting the family into low-end and high-end parts. E8 hit the market first with drives shipping by the end of 2017, while the E12 controller is currently sampling with drive shipments expected later this year. (We received an engineering sample with the E12 controller last week, and will be reviewing it soon.).", "The E8 controller features a PCIe 3 x2 host interface and has four NAND channels, so at first glance it seems clearly inferior to the earlier E7 controller that aspired to be high-end. However, the E8 is getting paired with much more advanced NAND than the planar MLC the E7 was used with, and the E8 controller features numerous architectural refinements over the E7, especially in its error correction capabilities. The end result is that drives using the E8 controller are able to offer a much more attractive balance of price and performance. The upcoming E12 controller should surpass the E7 in every way and we expect it to provide better performance and power efficiency than the E7 even when comparing E7+MLC against E12+TLC.", "MyDigitalSSD was first to market with their Phison E8 drive, and they set an aggressive pricing standard. With this product generation, Phison doesn't seem to have scored quite as many design wins, so we haven't seen the same flood of alternatives from Phison's usual turnkey SSD customers.

That latter controller has seen a few design wins in the retail market, most notably in the HP EX900.

Sale prices occasionally bring these drives down near the price level of the Kingston A1000.", "This year, the high end of the NVMe SSD market is more competitive than ever before. Samsung still dominates with their premium MLC-based 970 PRO, but the more reasonable TLC-based 970 EVO faces stiff competition from both SM2262 drives and Western Digital's second-generation WD Black SSD.", "There are also still some older cheaper NVMe SSDs on the market using 32L 3D NAND or even planar NAND. The Intel 600p and first-generation WD Black can't keep up with newer drives for performance, but they may still occasionally be found at low prices. The Patriot Hellfire and Team T-Force Cardea are Phison E7 drives with 15nm MLC, comparable to Kingston's existing KC1000 NVMe SSD.", "In spite of the wide array of NVMe competitors now on the market, the most important competition for the Kingston A1000 still comes from SATA SSDs. It's relatively easy for a NVMe SSD priced like the A1000 to make an attractive value proposition in comparison to premium NVMe drives, but it's much harder for the A1000 to prove that it is a worthwhile upgrade from mainstream SATA SSDs that are much cheaper."]},

A small gap (for the transfer of the videos suite from the primary drive to the RAM drive) is followed by three sets for the next data set. Another small RAM-drive transfer gap is followed by three sets for the Blu-ray folder.", "An important point to note here is that each of the first three blue and green areas correspond to 15.6 GB of writes and reads respectively. Throttling, if any, is apparent within the processing of the photos suite itself. Here, we see the average write speeds for the second pass of the photos suite being slightly lower than the first pass. This points to exhaustion of the SLC cache, but, the effect is not as stark as our DIY configuration because of the inherently lower interface link speed.", "The temperatures are also a bit on the higher side compared to our DIY configuration. The Evlvr internal SSD reached 67C by the time we got to the end of our test suite (compared to the 57C of our DIY configuration). It is possible that the final firmware from Phison might opt to run the SSD a little cooler by sacrificing a bit of performance. In any case, the current configuration sampled by Patriot does run a bit toasty compared to both our DIY configuration and the 240GB version of the TEKQ Rapide.", "The Thunderbolt 3 specifications indicate that the host port must be able to supply up to 15W for bus-powered devices connected to it. Since the Patriot Evlvr is a bus-powered device, it is given that its power consumption can't exceed 15W in order to be a certified Thunderbolt 3 device. It is still relevant to take a fine-grained look at the power consumption profile. Using the ", ", the bus power consumption for both SSDs was tracked while the CrystalDiskMark workloads were processed. The workloads were set up with an interval time of 30s.", "The peak power consumption remains below 6W, but, the average bus power draw over all workloads is consistently higher than the other units being compared.", "Support for TRIM is important to make sure that the performance consistency is maintained even after the SSD has been subject to long-term use. Since the Thunderbolt interface is transparent for all practical purposes, and the host OS sees a PCIe NVMe SSD, it comes down to the internal SSD supporting TRIM. We were able to successfully activate TRIM in the Patriot Evlvr.", "The final aspect that needs to be addressed is the pricing - Patriot announced that the 1TB variant of the Evlvr would retail at $490. On a per-GB basis, this translates to the Evlvr being the most affordable Thunderbolt 3 SSD that we have tested. We believe that the target market for Thunderbolt 3 SSDs can be divided into two - one belonging to the professional content creators market where time is money, and the other being the average consumer that just wants a fast portable drive and is only read to pay a small premium over a USB-based flash drive like the Samsung Portable SSD T5 or the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD. The former requires extreme performance, and is willing to pay the price premium for that - Devices like the ", ", ", ", ", ", and our DIY configuration with a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD (SanDisk Extreme Pro M.2 NVMe 3D SSD with the TEKQ Rapide enclosure) target that market. The Patriot Evlvr is one of the first portable Thunderbolt 3 SSDs to target the latter segment. That said, one of the aspects that make devices such as the Patriot Evlvr (and other low cost Thunderbolt 3 SSDs that will use the Alpine Ridge controller) a tough sell is their incompatibility with the generic USB Type-C ports. These SSDs work only with Thunderbolt 3 ports, and while the former market segment is able to easily understand that, the second segment may increase the customer support workload.", "Flash prices are on a downward trend, and it is possible that the 1TB Evlvr could launch at a price lower than the planned $490. Even at that price, devices such as the Patriot Evlvr are sure to please cost-conscious consumers, and that is bound to benefit the Thunderbolt 3 ecosystem."]},

The new Toshiba XG6 is an update to their ", " for the OEM market. The new 3D TLC NAND should help reduce costs, and will also allow for significantly higher performance. The XG5's performance wasn't competitive with high-end NVMe drives but was plenty for most purposes, and the XG5 was the first NVMe SSD to offer power efficiency similar to SATA SSDs on a variety of workloads. Toshiba promises similar efficiency from the XG6 in spite of the increased performance.", "The Toshiba XG6 is still using the same controller as the XG5, so the improvements are mostly due to the new NAND flash, plus some firmware optimizations. The new 96L 3D TLC supports Toggle NAND 3.0 interface speeds in the 667-800MT/s range compared to the 400-533MT/s speeds used by earlier 3D NAND from Toshiba, so data can be moved between the controller and the NAND more quickly (Toshiba didn't disclose the exact speed used on the XG6). The 96L NAND itself has shorter read and program times than the 64L BiCS3 TLC, so the faster interface won't go to waste. The NAND page size hasn't increased, so there isn't any extra overhead for managing small IO sizes compared to what the XG5 has to cope with. As with the XG5, the XG6 will use a mix of 256Gb and 512Gb TLC dies depending on the drive capacity, so the smaller models won't suffer as much from the reduced level of parallelism that would come from using the largest (and cheapest) die across the entire range.", "The XG6 is not intended to be a complete replacement for the ", " that targets higher capacities and sustained performance, but an XG6-P has not been officially announced. However, the XG6 does support user-configurable overprovisioning using a new standard command from the NVMe 1.3a specification, so it has the potential to deliver better steady-state performance than it will provide out of the box.", "The XG6 will be available in versions with and without TCG Opal encryption support. The non-encrypting models still implement the basic TCG Pyrite security specification.", "The Toshiba XG6 is currently sampling to OEMs and will be showing up in notebook computers soon, replacing the XG5 over the next few quarters. Toshiba never released a retail version of the XG5, but it seems likely that the XG6 will see a retail version to replace the aging and expensive OCZ RD400, which was based on the XG3 OEM SSD."]},
{"title": "Next-Gen NAS: An Interview with Alex Wang, CEO of Synology America", "paragraph": ["As the Senior Editor in charge of covering the NAS market, I have had the opportunity to field questions and comments about Synology products from a number of readers. Personally, I have always wondered about the limited hardware configurations available for the Synology NAS models compared to, say, offerings from QNAP. I have also recommended them to a few home consumers and SMBs, who have ended up being very satisfied with their purchase. On the other hand, I have also recommended some of their products for use in a SME setting, and the IT administrator who took up my suggestion (back in 2015) didn't have a great experience from a customer support perspective. Given these aspects, I had plenty of questions for Alex when I was pitched the opportunity to interview him.", "Broadly speaking, I wanted to address three main topics:", "In addition I also wanted to discuss miscellaneous aspects such as security and privacy, along with Synology's expansion into allied markets such as wireless routers.", "Synology started out with the DS-101, a single-bay IDE enclosure with a 100 Mbps network port (targeting the home and SOHO market) back in 2004. Since then, they have expanded to multi-bay enclosures and rackmounts with high-speed network interfaces targeting SMBs and SMEs in addition to prosumers. In the recent years, they have launched all-flash arrays too. I had always wondered about the market segment that provides Synology with the highest return on investment, and Synology's internal estimated market share in those different niches. Would Synology's success in the SOHO / SMB space give it the impetus to challenge established enterprise vendors? I took this interview opportunity to find out Alex's thoughts on these aspects.", "Synology's primary challenge in moving higher up the value chain has been its after-sales support. Some efforts have been taken recently to address this issue, and the interview turned out to be a good opportunity to gather the specifics. Synology was one of the earliest CE device vendors to provide users with a cloud service to augment the core product features. Recently, the cloud has become a revenue driver for many vendors. Does Synology see any subscription-based cloud services as a significant growth area? How does Synology prioritize the features to implement in the DSM OS? The interview provided me with some answers.", "A common complaint that I have received from readers (and, also one of my own) regarding the Synology models is the absence of affordable non-Atom class NAS units (something available from vendors such as QNAP and Asustor). In addition, Synology also actively avoids experimentation, while vendors such as QNAP have no hesitation  (eg. bring Thunderbolt-enabled NAS units, and affordable NAS units that can double up as direct-attached storage devices with an USB interface). The interview gave me the perfect opportunity to get Synology's reasoning behind the absence of such NAS devices.", "Without further digression, we move on to the transcription of our interview with Synology America's CEO, Alex Wang. We gave also had a peek at some of the upcoming Synology products and will conclude with our own thoughts on Synology's approach to the NAS and allied markets.", "Alex: First of all, the traditional definition of power users, SMBs and SMEs may not apply here as many businesses use small NAS in their environment while power users might have rack servers in their home labs. It’s difficult to say how different types of products are distributed among these segments since we can’t be certain of the usage scenarios.", "However, let’s assume 8-bay desktop NAS and below are for power users and devices with more bays or rack servers are for SMBs and SMEs. The business segment accounts for 40% of our revenue in the U.S., but is 27% if calculated worldwide. In terms of growth, business NAS numbers have seen an average of 20% increase for the past five years, while the growth of the power user NAS segment was relatively slower. However, home NAS has been catching up with 15-20% growth since 2017, which largely results from the rise of privacy concerns and people wanting to own their data and build a private cloud.", "Another market I would like to highlight is video surveillance. According to our statistics, 10% of the NAS in the wild are paired with security cameras. And the annual growth rate of our surveillance license sales is 40% over the past five years. The strong demand of physical security will continue to drive the growth.", "Alex: First, let’s talk about the storage market. How big is the market and which segment Synology is in? We share the “traditional” power user NAS market with a lot vendors, such as Buffalo, Netgear, QNAP, and WD, in which we take approximately 40-50% of the market. From a completely different perspective, Synology probably only accounts for less than 1% of the market share if you consider public cloud storage providers as our competitor. However, public cloud storage and NAS are not necessarily substitutes for each other, but rather should be considered complementary and can work together to build a seamless storage solution.", "The NAS market for business is more complicated, because the ways that NAS is used vary from one organization to another. Some use NAS for backup, while others might use them for tier-1 application storage or virtualization storage. Storage vendors with such capabilities include EMC, NetApp, HP, etc. There are all-flash array vendors like PureStorage and Nimble Storage, and those with hyper-converged solutions like Nutanix, etc. Synology NAS can be used in all the above scenarios, as virtualization storage, a hyper converged application server, or as a backup server for various business workloads. Since this market is huge, I estimate we take less than 1% market share.", "Alex: For sure! We are seeing many SMB/SME users moving from traditional storage vendors to Synology solutions, which are more affordable and user-friendly, provide more functionality, and allow people to do more with their data.", "There are more than 5 million devices deployed worldwide since we released out first NAS in 2004. A user base of that size is huge compared to other business storage vendors, which means there are millions of people using Synology NAS in a range of environments, so we can identify and fix problems faster than others. Also, we have two major DSM releases every year, along with timely security updates. Fast response to vulnerabilities and software quality are what set Synology apart.", "Alex: We understand that after-sales support is very important to both home and business users. As a matter of fact, we are undertaking quite a few changes to better the service for the North American market.", "Besides doubling the manpower in the West Coast support team, we set up an East Coast office near Washington D.C., allowing us to offer free phone and chat support from 4am - 9pm PST. However, it is hard to troubleshoot over the phone for complicated issues. We highly suggest customers to submit a support ticket online. Usually our response time is within 24 hours, including weekends. Most of the users receive a response within a few hours. For example, 30% of the tickets received responses within four hours in April.", "Additionally, we have high-priority support for our reseller partners or users with high end models, such as XS/XS+/FS products. These users usually receive several responses during the day, which is not bad compared with other paid support offerings.", "For hardware issues, we do offer options for expedited hardware replacement. Instead of paying for SLA, you only pay when necessary. For high end models, such as 2U rack servers, we offer a free next business day replacement, which is called SRS (Synology Replacement Service).", "Some VARs recommend business users set up a high availability cluster, which is the easiest way to double the reliability by having a passive server take over when the active server experiences issues. The cost to build a high availability cluster with Synology is very competitive, and it gives VARs more time to help customers fix the problem with minimum downtime.", "We understand that support can always be enhanced and are constantly thinking of ways to improve our support service. With that in mind, I’m glad to announce that 24/7 customer support is in our plan and will be available in the near future.", "Alex: Technology changes fast. Vendors are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities. We are always open to adapt new concept, such as cloud-reliant products, as long as it make sense. The same for business model; it doesn’t matter if it is subscription-based or not, we are all for it as long as the product or service can provide value to our users.", "Our product development has always been driven by the mission to “bring extra value to the customer.” Synology announced several products recently besides NAS. We started to provide the Synology C2 Backup service worldwide, which allows users to subscribe and back up their NAS to Synology’s own cloud storage. We introduced applications like MailPlus – a private cloud mail server--and Active Backup – for business to back up their PCs, virtual machines, or public cloud workloads to a centralized location. We also introduced a license model for advanced business applications to help people avoid additional costs if the service is not relevant to their workflow, while other users can enjoy high quality applications at a reasonable cost.", "Alex: Our product feature ideas mainly come from 3 sources – direct customer feedback, channel feedback from reseller/media partners, and Synology internal team.", "Direct customer feedback is very important for us. Our CEO and management team used to review every single support ticket and make sure to address the reported issues and feature requests. Even now, we still have a way for management to review direct feedback from our users and take it into account when making plans for product development.", "However, it is up us to make the final decision on how to deliver the best solution for our customers, since feedback might be contradictory from different sources. For example, business users wanted us to remove Download Station while home users love it. We made it into a package to satisfy both segments in the end. Some features might be requested by a lot users, but we decided to go in a different direction after careful evaluation. Most importantly, we always make sure to delivery extra value to users when adding new features to our NAS.", "We had four major DSM releases in the past three years, DSM 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2, which introduced tons of improvements and new features, such as Synology Drive, Office, Moments, Active Directory Server, Hyper Backup, etc. Personally, I think the most important and useful feature for all segments is snapshots, which makes it extremely easy to restore files and protect users from ransomware.", "Alex: We recruited lots of engineers on filesystem development when started our business in 2000 and were using UFS, ReiserFS, EXT2, EXT3, and EXT4 back then. Adapting to a new filesystem is a significant decision to make. We had a very comprehensive testing plan for different scenarios and spent two years tuning and making sure it has production quality on performance and reliability before finally deciding to move to Btrfs, which also comes with great features such as snapshots, checksum, and group quota, and more.", "Right now, we have Btrfs on all x86 and 64bits ARM platform models. More than 90% of users choose Btrfs during new NAS installation according to our observations.", "ZFS was on our list but given up for several reasons. First and the most important, reliability. ZFS on Linux is very new. The most important layers of ZFS source code are “re-implemented” on Linux because of license issues. Second, performance. ZFS requires more memory and the performance is not better than Btrfs in compact NAS servers. I’d say both ZFS and Btrfs provide great feature sets, but the latter fits better with our solutions.", "Alex: We understand the love for new CPUs and more hardware options and are constantly looking for new ideas. We actually work closely with CPU vendors, who usually send us new CPUs at very early stage and seek our help to develop sample designs for motherboards.", "There are several factors affecting which CPU to use in the end, such as cost, performance, maturity, or whether it fits into our current portfolio. We won’t release a new product that performs the same as its predecessor does with a higher price tag just to say it has a newer CPU.", "We still have quite a few stages to go after deciding on a new platform, from design review, sample run, pilot run, to full software testing, disk compatibility test, thermal test, mass I/O stress, and many other reliability tests. The comprehensive testing process is the main reason why new CPUs are adopted later.", "Alex: We try to find the balance between cost and performance when choosing CPU. Performance-wise, CPUs like Denverton or Avonton are very powerful for prosumer and SMBs considering the limitation of network bandwidth. Even for heavy applications like running a mail server, web server and multiple user synchronization, Denverton CPU is definitely powerful enough to handle those tasks easily. We would like our users to get the most performance out of the product without breaking the bank.", "I also agree that several applications, such as “NAS as VM Host” can use some extra computing power and more memory. For example, Atom CPU is capable to run virtual machines. But it’s better to use higher end CPUs if the applications in the virtual machine need more computing power. However, if the cost of the NAS would be $500 more in order to run one or two VMs, why not buy a mini PC?", "So we think about it differently. First, why would you use NAS as a VM host and who needs it? For prosumers, running VMs directly on NAS is for lightweight usage because of the cost of high-end CPUs and RAM. Businesses would be more serious virtualization users, and they’d probably prefer Xeon CPUs and run more heavy duty VMs in their production environments. Therefore, we decided to include features like VM high-availability design, VM clustering, and live migration without service interruption when implementing our own VM host. We also integrated virtual machine hosting with our backup solution to let users power on the VMware or PC server backup directly on the NAS.", "Making decisions on those platform and CPU selection is not easy. I believe our sound feedback channels will lead us to the right direction.", "Alex: We don’t really see the benefit now as the performance of Thunderbolt DAS is no better with 10GbE NAS while the price is much higher. You can actually buy a Xeon CPU NAS at the same cost. However, we will watch the market closely and take it into consideration if the cost/performance ratio for Thunderbolt is good for our users.", "Alex: Concerns about data security and privacy are the reasons why people start seeking ways to build their own cloud and find Synology. These two subjects are part of our core values.", "In order to cope with GDPR, we conducted a third-party audit and revamped parts of our internal systems, such as the Synology Account site, customer support system, and event registration, which was a nightmare for our IT team but they survived.", "I think our stance on data security is self-explanatory if you own a Synology NAS. Users might notice that new software updates are extremely frequent to add new features or address security issues. At Synology, we react on security issues quickly thanks to our department called PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team). Security issues are usually addressed in a few days depending on the severity. Additionally, Synology is part of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authority, meaning we can assign our own CVE numbers.", "Based on our evaluation, the impact of Spectre and Meltdown to our systems is minimum if you are not running Docker, personal Web Station, or Virtual Machine Manager. However, we are work with relevant vendors to address these issues. Knowing the fix for this issue is very complicated, we are running additional tests to be cautious. I believe the patch would be ready soon.", "Alex: The data storage market was very mature when we introduced our first NAS. Especially for the business segment, technology like Tape Backup had existed for decades but then the market transitioned to large capacity hard drives and tape backup became less popular. Nowadays, cloud plays an important role in the storage market. Mature markets can be disrupted by new technology.", "When entering the market for home data storage, Synology was not the first vendor offering compact NAS solutions. But we were the first to bring high end features to the entry-level market by adding a portfolio of interesting applications and introducing a new user interface for easy data management, which have become standard features for a consumer NAS now.", "Same for the router market. The way people use Wi-Fi routers wasn’t much different from 10 years ago. But we can feel the market is changing slowly. We believe with our networking and software expertise, we can bring new excitement to the router market.", "We developed our expertise and released RT1900ac and RT2600ac after integrating Wi Fi and router features in our DS213air back in 2013. These products soon received a tremendous amount of positive feedback. This is just a start, however, more innovations have yet to come.", "Alex: On the software side, you could expect DSM 7.0 to come out later this year, which would continue the concept of Synology as a hyper converged server and let users do more with their data. On the hardware side, we just launched our first 6-bay Plus series NAS DS1618+. You can expect products in new categories, such as a 6-bay Slim series, 8-bay rack server, and 4-bay XS+ series later this year. As 10GbE demand increases, you can see our 10 G Base-T solution coming out soon as well. For networking, a brand-new Synology Mesh Router system will be launched this year with advanced Safe Access apps for parental control, content filtering, and threat detection. Like what was done for NAS, we are bringing high end business features into consumer routers.", "With more and more applications being added into the Synology ecosystem, it’s more of a powerful hyper converged server than merely a storage device. We always make it our mission to go beyond data storage, bring data to life for users to collaborate and accomplish more.", " ", "Synology has evolved into a respected vendor of SOHO / SMB NAS equipment over the last decade. They have been attempting to get a foothold in the SME space, and as expected, they have faced some growth pains. That said, the evolution of various DSM features, along with the improvement in customer support, is bound to help Synology in the enterprise market segment. The opportunity for subscription-based value additions is likely to boost revenue prospects. On the home consumer side, the private cloud aspect, coupled with some of the newerl deep-learning based applications inside DSM, are differentiators in favor of Synology.", "As a power user, I would say I am more impressed with the breadth and depth of the portfolio of a vendor like QNAP on the hardware front. Synology opts for a more prosaic approach, with a limited number of models to target as wide a market as possible. The DSM features and applications are also getting well-delineated based on the target market. It does seem to be working out well for them from a business perspective.", "On the wireless routers side, Synology is still in the follower mode compared to established vendors like Netgear, Linksys etc. That said, the SRM (Synology Router Manager) OS brings in a router management and usage UX that is currently unmatched in the market. Whether that helps Synology gain a foothold remains to be seen. It is early days yet on the Wi-Fi side.", "The challenge for Synology (and other NAS vendors too) on the home consumer side is to convince users of the need for a centrally accessible local storage in the network. With cloud backups for photos and videos becoming ubiquitous, one of the primary reasons for home consumers to get a NAS is out of the picture. Based on my interactions with Synology, it does appear that consumers are slowly seeing the benefits of the private cloud. Our hope is that more users see the light and don't trust the cloud as the only repository for their content.", "Synology states that the days of NAS as just 'network attached storage' are numbered. With their product portfolio, they want to define it as 'Networking, Applications, and Storage'. That, in our opinion, is a nifty tag-line to describe Synology's efforts over the last couple of years."]},

The new MR2200ac comes with mesh features. Similar to other mesh routers from the top tier vendors, the MR2200ac sports the Qualcomm IPQ4019 SoC with integrated dual-band Wi-Fi. The additional PCIe interface enables Synology to add a second 5 GHz radio, turning the MR2200ac into a tri-band router. Like the Netgear Orbi, the MR2200ac plans to use the second 5 GHz radio for backhaul purposes. Synology has built up on Qualcomm's Wi-Fi SON features to enable the MR2200ac to mesh with the RT2600ac (also Qualcomm-based). The RT1900ac, unfortunately, will not be compatible for meshing purposes. Synology is planning to bring in features such as easy parental control and threat prevention (antivirus / malware scanning etc.) to make their routers stand out in the crowded market.", "In terms of subscription-based value additions for business users, Synology is launching Active Backup for Office 365 as part of their Active Backup suite. The Active Backup for Business service includes backup of virtual machines, instant recovery, full disk image backups with dedupe etc.", "Being primarily focused on storage solutions, Synology will naturally offer several new NAS aimed at customers with different requirements later this year.

The DS619slim is based on Intel’s dual-core ", " SoC (Apollo Lake) outfitted with 2 GB – 8 GB of RAM. The NAS has six 2.5-inch bays for HDDs or SSDs, but it does not look that it supports caching on an SSD for additional performance (at least today’s entry-level NAS products from Synology do not support this feature). Meanwhile, since RAID stripe mode will be supported, we are still talking about read/write performance of about ~500 MB/s even with hard drives. As for network connectivity, the DS619slim will have two GbE ports.", "A more powerful NAS that Synology will have later this year is the DS2419+.

Not all of these have been particularly successful, but the most recently released drives use a formula that has been working well for several other players in the SSD market: Silicon Motion's SM2262 controller combined with Intel/Micron 64-layer 3D TLC NAND flash memory. The ADATA XPG SX8200 and GAMMIX S11 SSDs differ primarily in branding and the design of their heatspreaders, but underneath they both feature the same SSD architecture that we've found makes for a great combination of high performance and reasonable prices.", "The SX8200 and GAMMIX S11 replace several older ADATA SSDs that used Silicon Motion's first NVMe SSD controller, the SM2260. The ", " paired that controller with Micron's 32-layer 3D MLC NAND, while the ", " and ", " used Micron's 32-layer 3D TLC NAND. Those first-generation NVMe drives from ADATA suffered from the limitations of the SM2260 controller and the first-generation 3D NAND from Intel and Micron. As a result, even the use of MLC NAND in the SX8000 couldn't enable it to reach the performance of good TLC-based SSDs like the Samsung 960 EVO. The SX7000 and GAMMIX S10 were even worse off and despite ADATA's branding (and pricing) them like high-end SSDs, they were among the slowest NVMe SSDs on the market and could not reliably outperform mainstream SATA SSDs.", "ADATA has also released or announced several other consumer NVMe SSDs that aren't included in the chart above. The ", " and ", " use Realtek controllers and the ", " uses a Marvell controller. The Silicon Motion-based drives occupy the middle of the lineup and are the most popular and widely available NVMe drives from ADATA.", "This year, most of the SSD industry is working with 64-layer 3D NAND (almost exclusively TLC NAND), and there's no clear winner or loser in raw NAND performance this time around. Silicon Motion's second-generation NVMe controllers are capable of delivering far higher performance than the disappointing SM2260, and the market for high-end SSDs is no longer dominated exclusively by Samsung.", "Intel was first to market with the SM2262 controller in the ", ", which features some Intel-specific customizations to the Silicon Motion reference design. The ADATA XPG SX8200 and GAMMIX S11 are much closer to the reference design, but use NAND that has been binned and packaged by ADATA, and come with ADATA's own heatspreader designs. The other SM2262 drive we've reviewed is the ", ". Compared to the EX920, the ADATA drives have lower usable capacities due to reserving more spare area, which usually improves sustained write performance. Today's review focuses on 240GB and 480GB models from ADATA, which gives us a chance to see what performance is like at the more affordable end of the product line. We can also compare the performance of the SX8200 with no heatspreader against the GAMMIX S11 with a heatspreader (and with slightly newer firmware). Spoiler: those differences never matter to real-world usage. For all practical purposes, the SX8200 and GAMMIX S11 are just cosmetically different.", "ADATA's performance specifications for the SX8200 and GAMMIX S11 show that the 240GB models are significantly handicapped for all access patterns other than sequential reads. Even so, that smallest SX8200 is rated to easily outperform the largest and fastest model from the preceding SX8000 family. With the move to higher-density 3D NAND, ADATA has dropped the 128GB capacities from the lineup.

Samsung expects its first QLC-powered NVMe drives to offer up to 2500 MB/s sequential read speed as well as up to 160K random read IOPS, significantly outperforming high-end 10K RPM HDDs. Evidently, high-capacity QLC-based SSDs are supposed to substitute multiple 10K RPM hard drives working in a RAID array, so comparing performance of a single SSD to a 2.4 TB HDD may not be too representative, especially when power consumption is taken into account.", "Another lineup of Samsung’s products to use 3D QLC V-NAND will be client SSDs featuring capacities higher than 1 TB. These drives will use a SATA interface and will offer sequential read and write performance of around 520 MB/s (when SLC write caching is enabled), according to details that Samsung disclosed at its SSD Forum.

This is a higher capacity drive than any of the SM2262 SSDs we've tested, and some performance improvement may be due simply to the capacity increase.

The usable capacity is configured as about 2000 GB. The PCB layout is generally the same as for the SM2262 drives we've seen, with one DRAM package and two NAND packages on each side. This drive uses 2GB of Micron DDR4 DRAM, while all of the SM2262 retail drives we've seen use DDR3L.", "The switch to DDR4 gives a slight improvement to voltage and latency, and a big boost to throughput—which is probably necessary to make the most of the EN controller variant. The use of DDR4 does add slightly to the cost of the drive, but not enough to prevent this change from carrying over into retail products. The DRAM update still leaves Silicon Motion a bit behind Samsung, which has moved its SSDs to LPDDR4 and reaped significant power savings.", "For this review, the 2TB SM2262EN drive is compared against other recent NVMe SSDs, primarily high-end drives. The results from our engineering sample of the upcoming Phison E12 controller are also included, and these two new controller solutions will probably be responsible for the stiffest competition in the NVMe SSD market segment once they are both shipping in volume."]},

{"title": "SSD Form Factors Proliferate At Flash Memory Summit 2018", "paragraph": ["Last year, Intel and Samsung proposed new form factors for enterprise/datacenter SSDs with the goal of overcoming the shortcomings of the existing M.2, U.2 and PCIe add-in card form factors. ", " (previously known as NGSFF) had little presence at Flash Memory Summit this year without Samsung's participation in the show, but the derivatives of ", " were all over the place. Unfortunately, the Ruler has spawned not just one industry standard, but a whole family of new form factors.", "Working with SFF, the committee originally formed to standardize the 2.5 hard drive form factor, Intel's Ruler has led to the Enterprise and Datacenter SSD Form Factor (EDSFF) family of standards.", "The existing form factor options for enterprise SSDs have proven inadequate for datacenter needs. It is increasingly common for servers to use several types of SSD (boot drive, performance tier, capacity tier), and that usually requires using more than one SSD form factor. Each has its own downsides:", " Drives with the same 7mm thickness that consumer SATA drives use are relatively limited in maximum PCB area for NAND flash packages, and internal volume for power loss protection capacitors. Increasing the thickness up to 15mm allows for bulky capacitors and two PCBs stacked inside the drive's case, but this severely compromises the ability to cool the drive. Backplanes for 2.5 drives tend to be a severe airflow obstruction.", " Half-height half-length (HHHL or MD2) cards have plenty of PCB surface area for large amounts of flash and heatsinks that can handle 40W or more. Full-height cards increase these limits even more. This is the only current option for PCIe x8 or wider interfaces. Hot-swapping is possible with many cards, but this does little good when the cards are not accessible from the front of the server.", " Enterprise SSDs typically use the M.2 22110 card size that is longer than the 2280 card used by client/consumer drives. The extra space allows for higher drive capacities or power loss protection capacitors. However, the power and thermal limits are still severely constraining. Delivering more than 8W with only a 3.3V supply requires careful system design to ensure that enough current can be provided without the voltage dropping out of the required 5% tolerance. Dissipating 8-12W usually requires heatsinks that detract from the density advantage of such a small form factor. Hot-swapping is only possible by installing M.2 drives in some form of carrier module that further inflates the space occupied by each drive.", "The EDSFF family of SSD form factors share a common connector standard, which has also been adopted by the GenZ interconnect and the Open Compute Project's latest NIC form factor. The SFF-TA-1002 connector standard defines a multi-lane card-edge connector with a much smaller contact pitch than PCIe add-in card slots. Three sizes are defined, allowing for PCIe x4, x8 and x16 links, and narrower sockets can accept longer cards thanks to the notches in the card edge connector. The connector provides adequate signal integrity for data rates of at least 56 GT/s with a NRZ encoding (as used by PCIe) so it is more future-proof than most implementations of the existing connector standards for PCI Express signals. The smallest 1C variant allowing for PCIe x4 and power is 23.88mm wide, about the same size as a M.2 connector. The widest 4C variant supporting PCIe x16 links is 57.02mm, compared to about 89mm for a standard PCIe x16 slot.", "More important than the compact size of the connector is how a backplane full of them is constructed. The EDSFF form factors are intended to be used with right-angle style connectors that result in the backplane PCB being parallel to the bottom of the server with air flowing across it, instead of being oriented to block airflow and requiring holes to be cut in the PCB to get effective cooling. The end result is that a 1U EDSFF drive bay for drives up to 8mm thick allows more airflow than a typical 2U bay for 2.5 drives. There are still surface-mount host side connectors that would be used with a more typical backplane arrangement, but the airflow advantages of the right-angle connectors are very compelling.", "The actual pin-out is defined in SFF-TA-1009, which also specifies a 12V supply providing up to 70W per slot, plus a 3.3Vaux supply. This is close to the 75W that PCIe x16 slots can provide, and far more than the typical limits for any other drive form factor. The EDSFF form factors also specify that status LEDs are to be provided by the drive itself, controlled through a dedicated pin on the drive connector rather than being a component on the backplane shining through light tubes on a drive caddy.", "Intel's original Ruler proposal was targeted at 1U servers, with the intention of allowing for at least 32 drives to be mounted vertically in the front of a server. The first Rulers that Intel showed off were over 12 long, requiring drive cages far deeper than for any existing form factor. Many servers designs don't want or need to dedicate that much internal volume to storage, so a shorter variant has also been standardized and seems likely to be more popular. The EDSFF 1U Short form factor is defined in ", " and the 1U Long version is in ", ". The 1U Short is most similar to M.2 and Samsung's NF1 form factor. Like NF1, the 1U Short form factor features a wider card than M.2, allowing for two rows of NAND flash packages. 1U Short drive thickness is limited to 5.9mm or 8mm with a heatspreader, and this form factor is intended for drives up to about 12W. 1U Short drives have mounting holes in the corners and need to be installed in caddies for use in a typical hot-swap bay. Up to 36 of these drives can fit into the front of a 1U server.", "The 1U Long form factor is more than just a stretch of the 1U Short. The corner mounting holes are replaced by the expectation that the drive include its own case and latching mechanism at the front. Two thicknesses are defined: 9.5mm for drives up to 25W, and 18mm for drives up to 40W. While 2.5 drives that thick often use two stacked PCBs, the extra thickness of 1U Long drives is intended solely for heatsink fins and both sides of the drive have the same clearance for their heatsinks.", "Moving back toward traditional drive form factors, a set of 3 drive form factors has been defined, allowing for vertical mounting in a 2U server or horizontal mounting in a 1U server. The two lengths correspond roughly to that of 2.5 and 3.5 hard drives and are intended to allow for hot-swap cages of the same overall sizes. Drives can be either 7.5mm or 16.8mm thick, slightly thicker than the most common thicknesses for 2.5 drives. Like 2.5 and 3.5 drives, the EDSFF 3 form factors include a full casing around the drive, with the PCB mounted almost flush against one side of the drive instead of centered as in the 1U form factors.", "Hot-swap caddies are needed to provide a latching mechanism, but like the 1U form factors the 3 drives provide their own status LEDs. The drive-to-drive spacing is defined such that the two thicknesses can be mixed, and a 16.8mm thick drive can be inserted in place of two 7.5mm thin drives. A 1U server can fit 20 of the thinner 7.5mm drives, arranged as five stacks of four drives. Using 2.5 SSDs it is hard to achieve this density because of the bulkier connector. A 2U server with the drives in a vertical orientation can fit about 44 of the thinner drives.", "The recommended power and thermal limits for the 3 form factors varies from 20W for the short/thin size up to 70W for the long/thick size. The drives can use any of the three connector sizes, supporting up to PCIe x16.", "Almost all of the EDSFF hardware on display at Flash Memory Summit was using the 1U drive sizes. It appears that the 1U Short size will be the most popular, and the 1U Long will mostly be reserved for storage-oriented servers and JBOF enclosures. However, Intel did demonstrate a 1U Long accelerator card using a large Altera FPGA, taking advantage of the extra power and cooling provided by the thicker 1U Long variant.", "The 3/2U form factors are most likely to be used by servers designed to support a flexible mix of storage and compute/accelerator modules. The thicker 3 form factors could also potentially expose I/O connectors on the front of the server for things like network cards, but the current standard doesn't have anything to say about such applications.", "Microsoft Azure has been using pre-standard 1U Long Ruler cards as carriers for 4 M.2 drives in some of their systems, but the complexity makes those merely a short-term transitional solution. They have qualified one native EDSFF 1U Long SSD and put it into production, and are working on qualifying three more drive designs in that form factor. They are also looking into using the largest 3 form factor as a replacement for PCIe HHHL cards. HPE is considering adopting the 3 form factor for their next generation of servers, and many other vendors are keeping an eye on the EDSFF standards but have been less specific about their plans.", "The servers on display at FMS did not all use EDSFF form factors exclusively. We saw a 1U server with traditional 2.5 bays, but the last two bays had been replaced by a 6-drive bay for EDSFF 1U Short drives."]},

The Toshiba XG6 is still using the same TC58NCP090GSB 8-channel controller as the XG5, but with another year's worth of firmware development. The use of an existing controller probably helped Toshiba get the XG6 out the door sooner and ensure they could be first to ship drives with 96L NAND, but it is possible that the XG6's performance is being held back a bit by the older controller.

The XG6 is another single-sided design to maximize compatibility with the thinnest notebook computers. Our 1TB sample has two NAND packages each containing eight 512Gb BiCS4 3D TLC dies. Toshiba is using 256Gb dies on at least some of the smaller capacities, but they won't say specifically whether it's just the 256GB model or also the 512GB model.

Thanks to the power efficiency of Toshiba's controller, heat shouldn't be a problem at all.", "We don't get OEM SSDs in for review very often. Toshiba is only really sampling the XG series because it is where their 64L and 96L NAND have debuted, and they haven't had retail versions ready to sample instead.

The main benefits of Open NVMe is to enable the host to control when garbage collection events happen, which in theory should allow more of the spare capacity to be used and minimize garbage collection performance disturbance with NAND. Optane media is a write-in-place media, meaning there is no need to erase data before writing. This means that Optane SSDs do not have the same concept of garbage collection. This is one of the reasons Optane SSD performance is nearly the same for reads, or writes, or with a mixed workload.

Samsung compared the performance of this new 512Gb die against an unspecified competitor's 1Tb QLC, claiming that Samsung's high-performance QLC will have 37% lower read latency and 45% lower program latency. Their slides suggested that the performance differences relative to Samsung's own 1Tb part could be even larger, but Samsung did not quantify this.", "The first products featuring the second generation of Samsung's low-latency Z-NAND flash memory will be the SZ1733 and SZ1735, high-end enterprise NVMe SSDs that differ primarily in the amount of overprovisioning. Samsung has announced that their second generation of Z-NAND will include a MLC version, but these drives are using the SLC version. Like the TLC-based PM1733, the new Z-NAND SSDs will also feature dual-port capability and PCIe 4.0 support. Sequential reads of up to 12GB/s are claimed, but this product line is all about random I/O, which Samsung hasn't detailed yet.

The MP500 was Corsair's take on the Phison E7 first-generation NVMe SSD controller paired with planar MLC NAND. The MP510 adopts the new Phison E12 controller and Toshiba's 64-layer 3D TLC NAND. The result is a drive that aims for the high end and actually makes it this time.", "Earlier this year, we previewed the Phison E12 controller and its M.2 SSD reference design. The Corsair Force MP510 is based on that same hardware platform and features the same firmware version number, so not much should have changed except for the application of a Corsair logo and price tag. The Phison E12 is the high-end controller from their second generation of NVMe controllers, with the E8 as the entry-level NVMe controller with fewer PCIe lanes and NAND channels. Phison has close ties to Toshiba, and most Phison drives use Toshiba's NAND flash. Toshiba's transition to 3D NAND was relatively late and that stuck many Phison SSD vendors with uncompetitive SSDs last year, including most drives with the E7 controller. Toshiba's 64-layer 3D TLC has reversed that situation and is giving Phison SSD vendors access to cutting-edge flash that is fast, cheap, and power efficient.

We’ve seen solutions in this space include custom FPGAs to software breakout boxes, and more recently a number of the motherboard vendors have provided PCIe x16 Quad M.2 cards for the market. The only downside is that they rely on the processor bifurcation, i.e. the ability for the processor to drive multiple devices from a single PCIe x16 slot. HighPoint has got around that limitation.", "The current way of getting four NVMe M.2 drives in a single PCIe x16 slot sounds fairly easy. There are 16 lanes in the slot, and each drive can take up to four lanes, so what is all the fuss? The problem arises from the CPU side of the equation: that PCIe slot connects directly to one PCIe x16 root complex on the chip, and depending on the configuration it may only be expecting one device to be connected to it. The minute you put four devices in, it might not know what to do. In order to get this to work, you need a single device to act as a communication facilitator between the drives and the CPU. This is where PCIe switches come in. Some motherboards already use these to split a PCIe x16 complex into x8/x8 when different cards are inserted. For something a bit bigger, like bootable NVMe, then HighPoint use something bigger (and more expensive).", "The best way to get around that limitation is to use a PCIe switch, and in this case HighPoint is using PLX8747 chip with custom firmware for booting. This switch is not cheap (not since Avago is now at the helm of the company and increased the pricing by several multiples), but it does allow for that configurable interface between the CPU and the drives that works in all scenarios. Up until today, HighPoint already had a device on the market for this, the SSD7101-A, which enabled four M.2 NVMe drives to connect to the machine. What makes the SSD7102 different is that the firmware inside the PLX chip has been changed, and it now allows for booting from a RAID of NVMe drives.", "The SSD7102 supports booting with RAID 0 across all four drives, with RAID 1 across pairs of drives, or booting from a single drive in a JBOD configuration. Each drive in the JBOD can be configured to be a boot drive, allowing for multiple OS installs across the different drives. The SSD7102 supports any M.2 NVMe drives from any vendor, although for RAID setups it is advised that identical drives are used.", "The card is a single slot device with a heatsink and a 50mm blower fan, to keep every drive cool. Drives up to the full 22110 standard are supported, and HighPoint says that the card is supported under Windows 10, Server 2012 R2 (or later), Linux Kernel 3.3 (or later) and macOS 10.13 (or later). Management of the drives after installation occurs through a browser based tool or a custom API for deployments that want to do their own management, and rebuilding arrays is automatic with auto-resume features. MTBF is set at just under 1M hours, with a typical power draw (minus drives) at 8W. HighPoint states that both AMD and Intel are supported, and given the presence of the PCIe switch, I suspect the card would also ‘work’ in PCIe x8 or x4 modes too.", "The PCIe card is due out in November, either direct from HighPoint or through reseller/distribution partners. It is expected to have an MSRP of $399, the same as the current SSD7101-A which does not have the RAID bootable option."]},

The new 860 QVO establishes a new entry-level tier in Samsung's highly successful SSD product family. Unlike previous low-end offerings like the ", " and the ", ", the 860 QVO is getting a broad release and is here to stay.", "The Samsung 860 QVO is the first of a new wave of SATA SSDs that should be able to beat the prices on even DRAMless TLC-based SSDs thanks to the increased density of QLC NAND—and the 860 QVO itself is equipped with a full-size LPDDR4 DRAM cache.", "Samsung's consumer SATA product line now consists of the 860 QVO, ", " and ", ". The 860 QVO, EVO and PRO all share a common hardware platform based around Samsung's MJX SSD controller and their 64-layer 3D NAND, with the product tiers differing primarily in the number of bits stored per flash memory cell.", "The 860 QVO, from the box, is given a write endurace rating equivalent to 0.3 Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD), which even for the 1TB means 300GB a day, every day, which goes above and beyond most consumer workloads. Pricing is set to run at $150 for the smallest 1TB model, up to $600 for the 4TB model, making an equal cost per GB for the full range. It should be noted that ", "Two bit per cell MLC as used in the 860 PRO is now quite rare in the consumer SSD market and almost entirely absent from current enterprise SSD, having been largely replaced by three bit per cell TLC as used in the 860 EVO. With each increase in bits stored per cell, performance and write endurance decrease as SSDs need to be more careful to correctly discriminate between voltage levels, now up to 16 for QLC NAND.", "While controller advances and other NAND process improvements (especially the switch from planar to 3D NAND) allowed TLC to overcome almost all of its disadvantages relative to MLC, QLC NAND is not expected to do the same. Early projections for QLC NAND called for at most a few hundred program/erase cycles, which would produce drives that would require careful treatment with workload that treated the storage more or less as a write-once, read-many (WORM) media. As QLC got closer to mass production, the story shifted and it became clear that QLC NAND would have adequate endurance for use as general-purpose storage.", "Intel and Micron were the first to ship their QLC NAND, initially in the ", " enterprise SATA SSD and then in the ", "and ", " consumer M.2 NVMe SSDs. The 660p and P1 introduced QLC NAND to the consumer SSD market, but as NVMe drives they still carry a price premium over SATA SSDs. However, as mentioned above, the introductory MSRPs for the 860 QVO are not at all aggressive in comparison to the record-setting sales we've been seeing on TLC SSDs recently. Those sales are not due entirely to the holiday season—flash memory prices in general have been crashing now that everyone has their 64-layer NAND in full mass production while PC and smartphone sales have been slowing. Meanwhile, rumors indicate that yields on QLC NAND have been poor, so the true cost is close to that of TLC instead of reflecting the ideal 25% discount per-GB.", "The two main shortcomings of QLC NAND relative to the more mainstream TLC NAND are in write performance and write endurance. Both problems can be alleviated by the use of more NAND total, allowing writes to be spread across more NAND dies in parallel. That and the (hopes of) lower prices make QLC NAND best suited for large capacity SSDs. Thus, the 860 QVO product line starts at 1TB. Even at that capacity, the 860 QVO only needs 8 dies of QLC NAND and can only sustain writes at 80 MB/s. That means that the SLC write cache on the 860 QVO is even more important than for TLC SSDs. When working within the cache, the 860 QVO can saturate the SATA link with random or sequential writes. The cache functions much the same as the SLC cache on the 860 EVO, with a capacity that varies from a minimum of 6 GB when the drive is relatively full, up to 42 GB on the 1TB model or 78 GB on the 2TB and 4TB models. The Intel and Crucial consumer QLC drives also feature variable-size SLC caches but with much higher limits on the maximum cache size and a policy of retaining data in the cache until the drive needs the extra space. By contrast, the 860 QVO seems to take a more typical approach of aggressively flushing the cache during idle time in order to prepare for future bursts of write activity.", "The performance specs for the 860 QVO when operating out of the SLC cache are typical for a mainstream SATA SSD. After the cache is full, performance drops significantly, with sequential writes showing the most severe effect. Power consumption is also comparable to Samsung's other recent SATA SSDs, with the 1TB model requiring a little over 2W at peak and the larger models drawing just over 3W during writes. The 2TB and 4TB models have very nearly identical performance and power ratings, indicating that 2TB of QLC is sufficient to populate all the NAND channels of the MJX controller.", "The warranty and endurance ratings for the 860 QVO are the other clear area where the use of QLC NAND has its impact. The 860 QVO's warranty period is three years, typical for low-end SSDs but shorter than the 5 years that the 860 EVO and PRO carry. Write endurance is rated for 360 full drive writes, or 0.3 DWPD for the duration of the 3-year warranty. This is comparable to some of the cheaper TLC drives currently on the market, and in terms of total bytes written the 860 QVO's rating is about 80% higher than the Intel 660p and Crucial P1, despite those NVMe QLC drives having the advantage of a five-year warranty.", "The 860 QVO's case follows the same basic design as Samsung's other recent SATA SSDs, but is painted dark gray instead of Samsung's traditional black. Internally, the 1TB 860 QVO illustrates how comically oversized even the 2.5 drive form factor is compared to the requirements of modern consumer SSDs. The PCB features three main BGA packages: the DRAM, the controller, and the stack of eight 1TB QLC dies. There's an empty pad on the back that can accommodate another NAND package. Samsung commonly packages up to sixteen NAND dies together, so even the 4 TB QVO may be able to get by with this same small PCB—placing DRAM becomes the more important problem. Samsung states that their current MJX controller supports up to 8TB SSDs, but there's clearly very little demand for consumer SSDs in that capacity yet. The 2.5 form factor itself can now accommodate at least 16TB, or 32TB if two PCBs are stacked in a 15mm thick drive. These capacities may show up in enterprise products, but are probably still several generations away from hitting the consumer SSD market.", "Samsung has not announced a M.2 version of the 860 QVO, but that's clearly possible if the demand is there. They can probably fit even the 4TB 860 QVO onto a single-sided 80mm M.2 card.", "The launch MSRPs for the 860 QVO do not compare favorably against SATA SSDs already on the market. The 860 EVO is currently below the QVO's 15 cents per GB at 1TB and 2TB capacities, and plenty of other mainstream TLC drives are priced similarly. Samsung currently has no competition in the 4TB SATA SSD space, so their 4TB 860 EVO is substantially more expensive per GB, leaving appropriate room below for the 860 QVO. In order to be a strong competitor in the consumer market, the 860 QVO really needs to priced at no more than 13 cents per GB, and that limit is liable to come down further over the next several months as flash memory prices continue to drop and QLC yields improve.", "Samsung provided us with samples of the 1TB and 4TB 860 QVO. Testing the 1TB model went smoothly, but the 4TB 860 QVO has run into some problems causing the drive to disappear from the system interface. These issues are most noticeable when hot-swapping the drive, which is a regular part of our SATA SSD testing routine. There have also been challenges getting the 4TB drive recognized by a motherboard during the boot process, and this causes the boot to stall indefinitely on some of our systems.", "It should be noted that our testing regime is fairly streunous, and we sometimes get drive failures. It happens, and only a few of them are ever drive specific. ", "As a result, these problems do not appear to be specific to the 860 QVO or its use of QLC NAND and have been replicated on both the 4TB 860 EVO and 4TB 860 PRO with multiple host systems, but have not occurred with any of the smaller 860s. The 3.84 TB 860 DCT and the 4TB 850 EVO have also been trouble-free, so this isn't a problem with 4TB SSDs in general. We are still working with Samsung to determine the scope and nature of these issues with the 4TB drives, and it is not yet clear whether there is a general compatibility problem or if our testing procedure has triggered a firmware bug that put our samples permanently into an uncooperative mood.", "Because of these issues, some benchmark results for the 4TB drives have been delayed. Performance and price notwithstanding, I am unable to recommend any of the 4TB 860 series SSDs until I have a better understanding of the nature of the problems.", "There are no other consumer QLC SATA SSDs on the market yet, though ADATA has announced their SU630, which will feature alarmingly low capacities. The Intel 660p and Crucial P1 are the only other consumer QLC SSDs currently available, but they are priced for the NVMe market. Most of the competition for the 860 QVO will come from SATA SSDs with TLC NAND, both entry-level models with DRAMless controllers (eg. Toshiba TR200) and more mainstream models like the 860 EVO, Crucial MX500 and WD Blue. Almost all SATA SSD product lines feature a 1TB class model, but there are still relatively few 2TB models and no 4TB competitors have been announced. This will likely change as other QLC drives come to market, and even 2TB TLC drives have been getting more common this year."]},

Usability involves a combination of software and hardware that enables me to perform my tasks rapidly, without glitches, and with a battery life that lasts at least a day. I am practical too, so rigidity and resistance against dust and water are important as well.

It's been over five years since we last reviewed a Seagate consumer SSD, so for all practical purposes this is a fresh start for the company.", "Seagate has been one of the top names in the storage industry for decades, but it's almost exclusively for their hard drives. The company has been largely absent from the consumer SSD market, and their enterprise SSDs have never particularly stood out above the competition. By comparison, rival Western Digital managed to acquire SanDisk and with it a 50% stake in one of the largest NAND flash manufacturers. Seagate's acquisitions have been less fruitful: they bought controller designer SandForce right around when SandForce drives disappeared from the market for good. Since then, Seagate has had to buy controllers and NAND on the open market and provide product differentiation through firmware or by integrating their drives into storage appliances.", "The Seagate BarraCuda is not a revolutionary new SSD. It doesn't mark the release of a new SandForce controller but instead uses the very familiar and rather old Phison S10 controller. The flash is Toshiba's 64-layer 3D TLC NAND. Toshiba for their past has technically already started shipping their 96-layer TLC, but most of their production is still 64L and the 96L NAND hasn't made it into any retail SSDs yet, so the BarraCuda is up to date on the NAND choice.", "This is the first drive we've tested that pairs the Phison S10 controller with 3D NAND. We first reviewed this controller in 2014, so it has had an incredibly long lifespan for such a product. With the SATA interface no longer getting speed increases, the Phison S10 isn't as obviously outclassed as such an old controller would otherwise be. It's showing its age a bit with the lack of LDPC error correction or (LP)DDR4 support, but it has proven to be an adaptable chip, supporting several generations of planar NAND and staying relevant today with support for 3D NAND. It also supports SSD capacities of up to 2TB, which was extremely implausible for a consumer drive with the flash prices in 2014, but which are now available for less than $300.", "The specifications for the Seagate BarraCuda look about the same as any other mainstream SATA SSD these days: TLC NAND, sequential I/O performance that mostly saturates the SATA link, and random I/O performance at up to 90k IOPS. But real-world performance depends more on performance at low queue depths and on mixed workloads, not peak numbers at QD32. This is where newer SSD controllers may have an edge over the Phison S10.", "The BarraCuda is rated for a little under 0.3 drive writes per day over the duration of its 5-year warranty. We can be pretty sure that the controller can keep going that long because our earliest Phison S10 drives closing in on that age without problems. However, without the benefit of LDPC error correction, Seagate's write endurance rating isn't as conservative as the 0.3 DWPD we see on its competition.", "The Seagate BarraCuda actually uses a controller chip bearing Seagate's logo and part number, but we've seen this same basic board layout many times and in many colors. Seagate is hardly the only company that rebrands off the shelf controllers. The Phison S10 is an 8-channel controller so we get 8 NAND packages, with two 256Gb dies in each package. The metal case for the drive is the same that we're used to seeing on Phison S10 drives, but with yet another variation on the paint job.", "The main competitors for the Seagate BarraCuda are mainstream SATA drives like the Crucial MX500, Samsung 860 EVO, Intel 545s, and WD Blue/SanDisk Ultra 3D. These all feature 64-layer 3D NAND but more recent SSD controllers. For this review we've also included a pair of current-generation DRAMless SATA SSDs: the Mushkin Source and the Toshiba TR200, the latter of which uses the same NAND as the BarraCuda but Phison's S11 4-channel entry-level SATA SSD controller. We've also thrown in results for some older drives that used the Phison S10 controller with planar NAND: the Toshiba OCZ Trion 150 with 15nm TLC, and the PNY CS2211 with 15nm MLC.", "Perhaps the most interesting point of comparison is the Plextor M8V, a drive that's generally hard to find for sale, but is very useful here because it uses the same Toshiba 3D TLC NAND but pairs it with the Silicon Motion SM2258 controller instead of the Phison S10. This helps identify which performance differences are due to the choice of NAND and which are controller or firmware bottlenecks."]},

The peripheral circuitry can also be fabbed on a traditional logic process instead of a memory process—they're currently using a mature and thus very cheap 180nm logic process. YMTC is planning to make extremely high IO speeds a hallmark of their 3D NAND through the use of many planes per die. They are hoping to reach 3Gb/s from a single die, while the existing 3D NAND players are just starting to move beyond 1Gb/s."]},

For the Samsung 983 DCT M.2, we used a PCIe to M.2 adapter board that includes a 12V to 3.3V converter, and our measurements have been adjusted to account for the overhead of that converter.

Aspects that may influence this include thermal throttling and firmware caps on access rates to avoid overheating or other similar scenarios.

Now the third generation WD Black SSD is here, with the model number SN750 to avoid confusion with its predecessors. (Internally, last year's model was known as the SN700, and the OEM version was the SN720.) The new WD Black SN750 is an incremental update over last year's model, keeping the same basic controller and 64L 3D NAND combination but refining the firmware and adding a 2TB option. Western Digital is also shifting their marketing efforts more toward gamers with the addition of SKUs featuring a large heatsink.", "The second-generation WD Black launched last year delivered performance that is generally competitive with other top NVMe SSDs like the Samsung 970 EVO, while usually operating with far better power efficiency. The only other high-end NVMe SSDs that have similar efficiency are the Toshiba XG5 and XG6, but the controller they use puts them clearly in a lower performance class than the WD Black. However, last year's model was still the first release of a new controller architecture, so it is no surprise that Western Digital has some firmware improvements to deliver. It is a bit disappointing that those improvements aren't being distributed as free firmware updates to owners of last year's model, but Western Digital is not the only company that's taken this approach.", "Aside from the addition of the 2TB option, the most noticeable changes to the specs table are the vastly lower MSRPs: the 2TB will debut for only $50 more than the 1TB model was at introduction last year, and the smallest price drop is the 33% cut to the 250GB model's price tag.", "Performance has been improved slightly across most of the major metrics, but none of the improvements are anything huge. The 2TB model will actually be slightly slower than the 1TB, due in part to using 512Gb NAND dies instead of 256Gb dies so that the 2TB model can still be a single-sided M.2 card.", "The 2TB model and the SKUs equipped with heatsinks will be arriving this spring, but the plain 250GB through 1TB models ship this month. Western Digital has not provided MSRPs for the models with heatsinks, but we expect them to carry a bit of a premium when they arrive.", "Peeking under the label, we find essentially the same PCB as last year's model, though it appears we've gone from revision A to revision D.

The product packaging and labeling has been restyled, and all but the smallest model will soon be available in versions with a custom aluminum heatsink from EKWB. Additionally, there's a new version of Western Digital's new SSD Dashboard software for Windows that adds a Gaming Mode which re-configures the NVMe driver to not enable Autonomous Power State Transitions. When this gaming mode is enabled, the drive won't make use of its low-power idle states, which avoids the extra latency of waking the drive up after it has been idle for a few seconds. However, in our experience few gaming desktops are configured to use the deepest idle states, and the WD Black wakes up very quickly from its intermediate idle, so this feature will be inconsequential for most users.", "Our Linux-based synthetic performance tests are already conducted with APST off so that idle wake-up latency doesn't distort those results. Our Windows-based ATSB trace tests leave APST enabled, but the trace playback cuts idle times short enough that most NVMe drives won't be entering low-power states during those tests, either. The SYSmark 2018 test gives SSDs plenty of idle time to make use of their deepest idle states, but overall the workload it presents is not storage-intensive enough for WD's Gaming Mode to have a noticeable effect.", "It may seem odd that Western Digital is sticking with their 64-layer 3D NAND even months after their partner Toshiba started shipping 96L 3D NAND with the XG6, but the transition to 96L NAND will look very different from the transition to 64L NAND. The 64L generation leveled the playing field as Toshiba and Western Digital delivered their first 3D NAND worth mass producing, and Intel and Micron made significant performance improvements over their previous 32L NAND. As most of the major manufacturers largely caught up to Samsung and ramped up production, prices crashed. That's been great news for consumers, but has prompted the manufacturers to slow their investments into 96L production to avoid worsening the oversupply. Thus, we expect the 96L transition to proceed more slowly, taking all of 2019 and probably into 2020 before every 64L product line gets upgraded. The 96L upgrade has the potential to bring some significant performance and power improvements, but will in most cases require a new generation of controllers that can take advantage of higher controller-to-NAND interface speeds or lower operating voltages.", "Since last year's WD Black launched, the most important new competitors to hit the scene have been drives based on Intel/Micron NAND with the SM2262 controller, and drives using the same Toshiba/SanDisk NAND with the Phison E12 controller.

The 970 EVO Plus will be replacing the 970 EVO as Samsung's mainstream consumer NVMe SSD. Today we are reviewing two of the launch drives: the 970 EVO Plus at 250GB, and the 970 EVO Plus at 1TB. These two drives are Samsung's attack on both the mainstream and high capacity markets, while the new NAND has a focus more on power than driving down overall costs per GB. Performance per watt is a key focus of these drives. ", "Samsung's offerings for the 970 EVO Plus will range from 250GB to 2TB.", "Capacities up to 1TB will be available from today, with the 2TB model launching in April. Pricing for that part has not yet been announced, however it is likely to be at a similar price density per GB as the 1TB.", "Last fall, Samsung outlined ", ". Most of Samsung's SSDs that use TLC NAND will be updated to 9xL NAND while keeping the same SSD controllers as current products. While the consumer products will remain PCIe 3.0 for the time being, Samsung's top enterprise drives are getting an update to support PCIe 4.0. This means that the Samsung Phoenix controller that is at the heart of their retail, OEM and low-end datacenter NVMe product lines will be sticking around for another year, including in the new 970 EVO Plus and relatives like the PM981a and PM983a.", "Samsung's fifth generation, 9x-layer 3D NAND was ", " at Flash Memory Summit in 2017, and ", " with 256Gb TLC dies. However, last year saw NAND flash memory prices crash as good yields and high production volumes of 64L 3D NAND created an oversupply. The major manufacturers have been taking steps to slow their transition to 9xL NAND in order to avoid making that situation even worse for their profit margins, but they have not entirely halted the process. There's still strong incentive to provide annual updates to retail products, so it isn't surprising to see the 970 EVO Plus showing up now.", "Samsung's 9xL 3D NAND process doesn't provide huge density increases to further drive costs down, but it does provide numerous performance and power efficiency improvements that make it a good way for Samsung to improve a high-end product like the 970 EVO. The new generation of 3D NAND upgrades the interface between the controller and NAND to Toggle-mode DDR 4.0, increasing the interface speed from 800Mbps to 1400Mbps while reducing the voltage from 1.8V to 1.2V. This gives Samsung the lead for another generation, as 96L NAND from Intel, Micron and SK Hynix will only support up to a 1200Mbps interface, and Toshiba/SanDisk 96L NAND is only at 800Mbps.", "Within each NAND flash die, Samsung has made improvements to read and program latency, now down to about 50µs and 500µs respectively, improving by about 30%. Samsung is the only NAND manufacturer still increasing the layer count without resorting to manufacturing using string stacking, which Samsung has achieved by making each layer 20% thinner, but this has not affected the write endurance ratings for the drives. Samsung has notably fallen slightly behind in total layer count, with this generation only using 92 active layers compared to the expected 96 layers achieved by all their competitors.", "Lately, Samsung has been giving more detailed performance specs than any other consumer SSD vendor, including precise SLC cache sizes and write performance after the cache is full, and random IO specifications at both QD1 and at unrealistically high queue depths. On the other hand, we don't have full specs yet for the 2TB model because it won't be shipping until April, but the press release suggests a few small advantages over the 1TB model. The smaller models use 256Gb TLC dies but the 2TB model needs the 512Gb parts in order to fit enough flash on a single-sided M.2 card.", "Compared to the ", ", the 970 EVO Plus improves performance at every capacity and on every metric, but unevenly: the biggest gains are to write speeds, especially sequential writes. The 1TB model is now rated for 3.3GB/s writes to SLC cache compared to 2.5GB/s, and 1.75GB/s after the cache is full compared to 1.25GB/s. Random read speeds are about 20% better, and sequential reads see the smallest benefit with an increase from 3.4GB/s to 3.5GB/s; the PCIe 3.0 x4 interface is preventing anyone from doing much better than that.", "It's interesting to note that the 970 EVO Plus performance specifications all now exceed those of the MLC-based 970 PRO, except when the SLC write cache is filled. In those cases, the 970 PRO is still rated for an advantage of 25–255% depending on which capacity is under consideration and whether the writes are sequential or random.", "Hardly anything has changed about the construction of the 970 EVO Plus; the PCB layout is unchanged save for the adjustment of a few of the smallest passive components. The part numbers for the NAND packages have changed in one digit to reflect the new NAND generation and the date codes on all the major components are about a year newer. The label on the bottom of the drive still has a layer of copper foil as a token heatspreader while the label on the top is still just plastic.", "Samsung did not provide price information for the full lineup before launch, but the $89.99 MSRP for the 250GB 970 EVO Plus is only slightly above the current street prices for the 970 EVO and matches what Samsung sells it for direct, so we don't expect any significant changes in the near term for the other capacities. In the long run however, NAND prices are still in decline and Samsung has had to respond to that. The original 970 EVO was initially announced for around 45¢/GB but this was cut to 40¢/GB ", ". Now, it's going for around 25¢/GB. Further price cuts to the 970 EVO [Plus] are likely over the coming months, but the transition from one model to another will cause some fluctuations depending on which one is in stock at more retailers on any given day.", "Conspicuously absent from Samsung's 9xL roadmap last fall was any mention of MLC-based drives, and in particular Samsung has not mentioned a 970 PRO Plus. The lack of new MLC drives for the datacenter or OEMs is no surprise given how thoroughly those markets have shifted over to TLC. But on the consumer side, Samsung has been one of the few remaining holdouts offering MLC-based SSDs for enthusiasts and prosumers with their PRO drives.", "The later launch date of the 2TB 970 EVO Plus suggests that the only 9xL NAND Samsung is ready to release to the retail market is their 256Gb TLC; the 512Gb TLC and QLC parts are probably still in the sampling phase for either the memory itself, or the OEM or datacenter drives are still sampling rather than in full production. If Samsung plans a regular MLC part at 92 layers, it's almost certainly the lowest priority to move off 64L, after they get both TLC parts and both QLC parts out the door.", "We can't rule out the possibility of a '970 PRO Plus' sometime this year, but it seems far more likely that we won't see another PRO NVMe drive until 2020 with a new controller that may also bring PCIe 4.0 support. Until then, the 970 EVO Plus takes over the performance flagship position for Samsung's retail/consumer product line and the 970 PRO is only relevant for workloads that involve sustained writes of hundreds of GB per day. For workloads that merely consist of tens of GB per day or include some disk idle time for the SLC cache to recover, the 970 EVO Plus is now likely to offer both better performance and better pricing than the 970 PRO.", "(Samsung does plan to eventually introduce a MLC version of the second generation of their specialized low-latency Z-NAND, but they are still in the process of rolling out the SLC version, and Z-NAND's layer count is lagging behind their general-purpose V-NAND 3D NAND. Samsung has not mentioned any plans to use Z-NAND outside of their datacenter product lines. At the other end of their NVMe product spectrum, they've disclosed plans for a 980 QVO with QLC NAND, but we aren't sure when to expect that to launch, or whether it will introduce a new controller or continue with the Phoenix controller.)", " ", "For the review today, we are testing the 250GB and 1TB versions of the Samsung 970 EVO Plus."]},

This lets drive vendors advertise performance specs that rival the fastest flash-based SSDs on the market, but those specs usually don't have much relation to real-world performance. SM2262EN controller and firmware platform makes very different tradeoffs than the SM2262, and the improvements to peak performance on the SM2262EN have unavoidable costs elsewhere.", "The most significant advertised improvements for SM2262EN drives over their predecessors are to write speeds, with both sequential and random write performance increasing by 50% or more.

Aside from these changes, the new SM2262EN drives are drop-in replacements for the outgoing models, with similar write endurance and power consumption ratings.

These may range from low-performance flash drives with an USB interface to full-blown RAID towers interfacing over high-performance links such as Thunderbolt 3. While Thunderbolt 3 remains a premium Intel-only interface for now, USB 3.1 Gen 2 has emerged as a mass-market high-performance alternative. It is available across systems based on chipsets from multiple vendors. In this context, high-speed USB 3.1 Gen 2 storage bridges are interesting to analyze.

The first category is still bottlenecked by the SATA interface, and typically delivers 500 - 550 MBps of throughput. The second category can come close to saturating the USB 3.1 Gen 2 interface. However, it depends heavily on the workload type. In order to consistently take advantage of the interface across a variety of workloads, it is necessary to place a PCIe 3.0 x2 or better NVMe SSD behind the USB interface.

The Optane Memory H10 is a significant change from the existing Optane Memory family of products, and is a unique 2-in-1 SSD combining 3D XPoint memory and QLC NAND flash memory on a single M.2 module. The H10 is essentially a consolidation of the existing Optane Memory M10 module and the Intel 660p QLC SSD onto a single drive. The Optane portion of the drive is intended to be used as a cache for the QLC portion of the drive, using the Optane Memory caching drivers for Windows that Intel has previously pitched for using with standalone Optane Memory M.2 modules and mechanical hard drives. Until now, Optane products have been difficult to fit into ultrabooks where two M.2 slots may be challenging and a 2.5 hard drive is out of the question.", "The Optane Memory H10 will come in three varieties, with QLC NAND capacities ranging from 256GB to 1TB. The 256GB model will have 16GB of Optane storage while the 512GB and 1TB will both have 32GB of Optane storage. All three capacities are implemented as single-sided M.2 modules, with approximately half of the card dedicated to the Optane controller, media and PMIC, while the other half contains the Silicon Motion SM2263 controller, DRAM and QLC NAND. The card as a whole has a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface, but each of the two SSD controllers gets just two PCIe lanes. Intel's caching software will support reading and writing data from both Optane and QLC simultaneously, so they rate the H10 for up to 2.4GB/s sequential reads even though neither half can exceed 2GB/s on its own.", "For random I/O, Intel rates the H10 for 32k random read IOPS and 30k random write IOPS at queue depth 1, and 55k IOPS for both at QD2. The random read ratings are significantly higher than we've measured from the Intel 660p QLC SSD, but are only a fraction of what the 32GB Optane Memory is capable of on its own, so Intel's clearly trying to provide a more realistic composite that reflects how real-world usage won't be able to entirely stay within the Optane cache.", "Idle power is rated to be under 15mW total, the result of both SSD controllers aboard the H10 being able to hit single-digit mW power when PCIe L1.2 sleep states are used.", "Write endurance ratings will go up to 300 TB on the 1TB capacity, a 50% increase over the QLC-only Intel 660p. The QLC portion of the Optane Memory H10 will still be using SLC write caching, but the high-endurance Optane cache will take a lot of write pressure off the NAND flash. The warranty period is the same 5 years that the Optane Memory M10 and Intel 660p carry individually.", "The Optane Memory H10 has narrower system requirements than previous Optane Memory products. Intel has always required a Kaby Lake or later system to use their Optane Memory caching drivers, but the previous Optane Memory drives were still plain NVMe SSDs at heart and could be used as either standalone drives or with third-party caching software in any machine supporting NVMe SSDs. Since the H10 bundles two drives on one card, it will require a host slot that provides all four PCIe lanes and supports operating them as two ports of two lanes each. Intel's caching functionality for the Optane Memory H10 requires their RST version 17.2 drivers, the first release series to enable Optane Memory caching of NVMe SSDs instead of just SATA drives.

(The first public leak of the Optane Memory H10 product name came from motherboard manufacturers advertising support on 300-series desktop boards.) Desktops with 300-series chipsets and at least two M.2 slots can already achieve essentially the same setup as the H10 using an Intel 660p and Optane Memory M10 module, so there isn't strong pressure for a retail release of the H10. The hardware features Intel relies on for Optane Memory caching and NVMe RAID on consumer platforms have been present since Skylake 100-series chipsets, but Intel has shown little interest in rolling out firmware support to older platforms.", "Our Optane Memory H10 review sample is arriving today, and we will have a full review out later this month."]},

{"title": "The Western Digital WD Blue SN500 SSD Review: Moving The Mainstream To NVMe", "paragraph": ["Western Digital's mainstream consumer drives have long been branded as WD Blue drives, and this carried over to SSDs after their acquisition of SanDisk. The first two generations of WD Blue SSDs were SATA drives using TLC NAND and were worthy competitors for the Crucial MX series and Samsung 850 EVO. The WD Blue SN500 is the third generation WD Blue SSD, and it moves the WD Blue brand over to a very different market segment: the SN500 is an entry-level M.2 NVMe drive.", "Western Digital has been selling consumer NVMe drives for a few years using their high-end WD Black branding, but NVMe isn't just for enthusiast products any more. For the past year we've been seeing most SSD brands offering a lower tier of NVMe products that sit between their SATA and high-end NVMe offerings, both in terms of price and performance. This entry-level NVMe niche has at times been squeezed down to almost nothing when there are particularly well-priced high-end drives, but the general idea of splitting the consumer NVMe SSD market into two tiers isn't going away. SATA is starting to be phased out of use for primary storage in client PCs. Western Digital started supporting that trend over a year ago with the PC SN520 SSD for OEMs, which the WD Blue SN500 is derived from.", "Despite bearing the WD Blue name, the SN500 is functionally not a direct replacement for the SATA WD Blue SSDs. The SATA predecessors offered capacities up to 2TB, while the SN500's only capacity options are currently 250GB and 500GB. Those are the most common and important capacity points for consumer SSDs, but the absence of 1TB and 2TB options are a glaring omission, especially now that 1TB drives are approaching $100. The lack of high-capacity versions of the SN500 make sense when considering the OEM SN520 it is based on: that drive was intended to compete against the smallest form factor SSDs used tablets and the thinnest notebooks. The OEM SN520 is available in form factors as small as M.2 2230, and even though the retail SN500 uses the more typical 80mm length that offers the broadest compatibility with consumer systems, it retains the same layout that puts all the electronics in the first 30mm of the card. The SN500 uses a design that was never intended to accommodate more than 512GB of flash. The extra length on the card is occupied only by the drive's label.", "Like many entry-level NVMe SSDs the SN500 uses only two PCIe lanes for its host interface, which ensures it cannot match the peak performance of high-end drives with PCIe x4 connections. The lower lane count helps keep the pin count and power consumption of the controller down, which are important factors for a M.2 2230 drive but matter considerably less for a retail drive like the SN500.", "The other major compromise in the SN500's design is that it does not feature a DRAM buffer for caching the mapping tables for translating logical block addresses (LBAs) into physical memory addresses. A DRAMless SSD usually has significantly lower performance than a mainstream drive with enough DRAM to store the mapping information for the entire SSD. In the NVMe world, the Host Memory Buffer feature allows SSDs to borrow a small amount of the main system RAM (usually a few tens of MB) for this purpose, offsetting the performance loss that DRAMless SATA drives cannot avoid. Western Digital chose not to use the Host Memory Buffer (HMB) feature for the SN500 and SN520, instead opting to include a few MB of memory in the controller itself, but nowhere near the 256MB or 512MB that would be included on drives with discrete DRAM chips.", "Aside from those two limitations, the SN500's controller shares the same basic architecture that the WD Black SN750's controller uses. Western Digital designed this architecture to scale across a wide range of products, so the cut-down configuration we find on the SN500 was part of the plan all along. These are the first generation of in-house NVMe controller designs from Western Digital, but based on our experience with the WD Blacks it doesn't feel like a 1.0 product: they skipped over all the disappointments that Silicon Motion and Phison had with their first NVMe controllers, and instead the WD Black went toe to toe with Samsung's NVMe SSDs. The WD Blue SN500 won't be setting any performance records with just a PCIe x2 interface, but it does have the opportunity to continue the impressive track record on power efficiency that Western Digital has been building.", "The WD Blue SN500 may be a bit low-end by NVMe standards, but its performance specifications are still far above what SATA SSDs can provide. The SN500's write endurance rating of 0.3 DWPD over a 5-year warranty is standard for mainstream and many high-end SSDs. The current retail pricing is about 10-15% higher than the good deals on mainstream SATA SSDs of comparable capacity, so Western Digital is only charging a small premium for delivering NVMe performance. There are other DRAMless NVMe SSDs and some QLC-based NVMe SSDs on the market that are cheaper than the WD Blue SN500, so the new WD Blue has to do more than just outperform SATA in order to be competitive."]},

Flash memory has also seen a recent drop in prices, and this has made high-capacity drives affordable. Current external flash storage devices fall under one of four categories:", "Today's review takes a look at two 2TB drives from Seagate (under the LaCie brand) and Western Digital. They belong to the second category in the above list, placing a SATA drive behind a USB 3.1 Gen 2 bridge.", "Thumb drives usually come with USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 interfaces, and are meant to plug in directly into the host port without an extra cable. Capacities have been steadily increasing, though very few high-end models boast of peak performance in the 300 - 400 MBps range. Most low-end and mid-range thumb drives have write speeds of the order of 20 - 80 MBps, and read speeds of the order of 100 - 150 MBps. Over the last few years, we have had vendors place a 2.5 SSD board behind a SATA - USB 3.0 bridge. These have now evolved into M.2 SATA SSDs behind a much smaller and more power-efficient SATA - USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C bridge. Such external SSDs now make up the bulk of the mid-range and high-end bus-powered external direct-attached storage devices. Consumers requiring very bus-powered external storage with very high performance are served by Thunderbolt 3 SSDs that are surprisingly affordable despite their performance profile. These SSDs put a M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD behind a Thunderbolt 3 controller and deliver performance equivalent to an internal PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 NVMe drive (up to 3 GBps). Recently, we have seen PCIe 3.0 x2 NVMe SSDs behind a NVMe-USB 3.1 Gen 2 bridge that provide performance numbers of around 1 GBps.", "The LaCie Portable SSD has the same internals as that of the Seagate Fast SSD that we had ", " back in September 2018, while the WD My Passport SSD 2TB variant is similar to that of the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD covered in the same review.

The latter helps determine availability of UASP support and provides some performance numbers under ideal scenarios. Real-world performance testing is done with our ", " involving robocopy benchmarks and PCMark 8's storage bench.", "We also evaluate the thermal performance of the external storage device by tracking its temperature as it is subject to the aforementioned real-world workload. Sustained writes, a notable weak point of many flash-based devices while also being a realistic use-case for DAS units, are also tested.

No claims are made about the write speeds, but the ATTO benchmarks provide some quick numbers. With Alpine Ridge, the My Passport SSD 2TB reaches read / write speeds of 538 / 526 MBps, while the LaCie Portable SSD 2TB reaches read / write speeds of 562 / 179 MBps. However, with the ASMedia ASM 2142 host, the numbers move up to 544 / 533 MBps for the WD My Passport SSD and 569 / 521 MBps for the LaCie Portable SSD. Unfortunately, these access traces are not very common in real-life scenarios.", "CrystalDiskMark, despite being a canned benchmark, provides a better estimate of the performance range with a selected set of numbers.", "As evident from the screenshot above, the performance can dip to as low as 26 MBps for the LaCie Portable SSD and around 30 MBps for the WD My Passport SSD with the ASM 2142 host controller. The performance with the Alpine Ridge controller is lower across all access traces compared to the ASMedia ASM 2142. In general, we find the LaCie Portable SSD providing better read performance, while the WD My Passport SSD performs better with writes.", "Our testing methodology for DAS units also takes into consideration the usual use-case for such devices. The most common usage scenario is transfer of large amounts of photos and videos to and from the unit. The minor usage scenario is importing files directly off the DAS into a multimedia editing program such as Adobe Photoshop.", "In order to tackle the first use-case, we created three test folders with the following characteristics:", "Across all the read benchmarks, the LaCie Portable SSD performs better than the WD My Passport SSD with both host controllers. In the case of writes, however, the situation is reversed. The Samsung Portable SSD T5 manages to outperform both SSDs for a couple of the write workloads. The SanDisk Extreme 900 with two SSDs in RAID 0 also manages to perform better than the two in some of the workloads. In general, we see the ASMedia ASM 2142 fare better than the Alpine Ridge host, the LaCie Portable SSD being faster for reads, and the WD My Passport SSD being better suited for writes.", "For the second use-case, we take advantage of PC Mark 8's storage bench. The storage workload involves games as well as multimedia editing applications. The command line version allows us to cherry-pick storage traces to run on a target drive. We chose the following traces.", "Usually, PC Mark 8 reports time to complete the trace, but the detailed log report has the read and write bandwidth figures which we present in our performance graphs. Note that the bandwidth number reported in the results don't involve idle time compression. Results might appear low, but that is part of the workload characteristic. Note that the same testbed is being used for all DAS units. Therefore, comparing the numbers for each trace should be possible across different DAS units.", "The numbers graphed above show the ASMedia ASM 2142 host faring better than the Alpine Ridge controller, and also exposes the issue with writes on the LaCie Portable SSD when used with the Alpine Ridge host. Overall, we see that the WD My Passport SSD performs better than the LaCie Portable SSD for these workloads (when used with the ASM 2142 host).", "Yet another interesting aspect of these types of units is performance consistency. Aspects that may influence this include thermal throttling and firmware caps on access rates to avoid overheating or other similar scenarios. This aspect is an important one, as the last thing that users want to see when copying over, say, 100 GB of data to the flash drive, is the transfer rate going to USB 2.0 speeds. In order to identify whether the drive under test suffers from this problem, we instrumented our robocopy DAS benchmark suite to record the flash drive's read and write transfer rates while the robocopy process took place in the background. For supported drives, we also recorded the internal temperature of the drive during the process. The graphs below show the speeds observed during our real-world DAS suite processing. The first three sets of writes and reads correspond to the photos suite. A small gap (for the transfer of the videos suite from the primary drive to the RAM drive) is followed by three sets for the next data set. Another small RAM-drive transfer gap is followed by three sets for the Blu-ray folder.", "An important point to note here is that each of the first three blue and green areas correspond to 15.6 GB of writes and reads respectively. Throttling for average user workloads, if any, is apparent within the processing of the photos suite itself. Since the ASMedia ASM 2142 host performs better than the Alpine Ridge host, it makes sense to only focus on the consistency and thermal characteristics of the two external SSDs with the ASM 2142.", "We can see that neither SSD throttles for our workload set, but, the WD My Passport SSD's internal temperature touches 72C at the end of our robocopy workload. The LaCie Portable SSD, on the other hand, stays under 45C despite taking approximately the same time to get done with the same workload. This clearly shows that the thermal performance and cooling solution of the LaCie Portable SSD is much better than that of the WD My Passport SSD.", "The performance consistency for real-world applications was looked at in the previous section. We recently added a test to determine the effectiveness of the thermal solution for sustained workloads. After deleted the SSD volume, a fio workload was set up to write sequential data to the raw drive with a block size of 128K and iodepth of 32 to cover 90% of the drive capacity. The internal temperature, instantaneous write data rate, and total amount of data written in total till that point of time were recorded.", "The focus in this test is also on the performance with the ASMedia ASM 2142 host only. We see two types of throttling in the above graphs. For the WD My Passport SSD, the drop in the write transfer rate is due to thermal throttling after the internal SSD temperature hits 75C (the write transfer rates drop from around 490 MBps to as low as 60 MBps). The LaCie Portable SSD exhibits much better consistency - there is no evidence of thermal throttling, as the maximum observed internal temperature is only 57C. There is a drop in the transfer rates from around 500 MBps to around 420 MBps, but, that appears to be due to the SLC cache running out.", "The above exercise also allows us to determine the SLC cache size and/or the amount of data that can be written in one shot without a drop in the write data rate. The graphs below plot the transfer rate and the total data transfer amount from the start of the fio workload to the approximate timestamp at which the transfer rate shows a significant drop.", "The thermal performance limit for the WD My Passport SSD with the Alpine Ridge host is hit after approximately 250GB of sustained writes, while just 165GB is enough with the ASM 2142 host (due to the higher write performance). For the LaCie Portable SSD, the Alpine Ridge host configuration is worthless, but, we see around 25GB of SLC cache with the ASMedia ASM 2142. This seems to correlate well with the ", " seen in the 1TB variant of the Seagate Fast SSD.", "Both SSDs are bus-powered, and it is given that the peak power consumption can't go beyond 5W to maintain compatibility with as wide a range of systems as possible. However, some Type-C ports can supply more power, and some external bus-powered DAS units can take advantage of that. Therefore, it is still relevant to take a fine-grained look at the power consumption profile. Using the ", ", the bus power consumption for both SSDs was tracked while the CrystalDiskMark workloads were processed. The workloads were set up with an interval time of 30s.", "When connected to the Alpine Ridge host, the WD My Passport SSD consumes less than 3.6W throughout the course of the workload set, and idles at around 1.3W. In the same setup, the LaCie Portable SSD behaves strangely, idling at 0.9W but having sporadic spikes of up to 5W. As mentioned multiple times in the preceding sections, the behavior of the LaCie Portable SSD with the Alpine Ridge host was not along expected lines. Moving on to the behavior with the ASM 2142, the WD SSD spends more time around the 3.6W mark, and even having a peak above 4W. The LaCie SSD has multiple peaks around 4.5W and even a couple in the 5.5W range, though idling power was as low as what was seen with the other host. These higher power numbers commensurate with the higher performance.", "Coming to the business end of the review, the WD My Passport SSD and the LaCie Portable SSD both provide great performance, though some caveats apply. Prior to discussing those, we take a look at the pricing aspect.", "The WD My Passport SSD is significantly cheaper than the LaCie Portable SSD. It also comes with hardware encryption support. However, the LaCie Portable SSD comes with some value additions such as a complimentary free month for the Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps plan and a three-year Seagate Rescue Data-Recovery Service plan. These value additions make the drive very attractive for content creators.", "Neither SSD is perfect - the My Passport could do with a better thermal solution, as it ends up throttling under scenarios where the LaCie Portable SSD has no trouble. On the other hand, the LaCie Portable SSD seems to have compatibility issues with the Alpine Ridge host controller on Windows, with the write performance getting severely hampered. The LaCie Portable SSD performs like a champ with the ASMedia ASM 2142 host, though. For the average user, the WD My Passport SSD is able to deliver good performance with both host controllers.", "As flash memory prices come down, it creates a chance for consumers to be able to purchase affordable high-capacity external SSDs. We fully expect to see QLC-based external drives hit the market soon, and that would become a value play for the manufacturer, rather than the consumer. As NVMe - USB bridge chips become more popular, it will create a high-end external SSD market, pushing out Thunderbolt 3 SSDs to the premium end. All things put together, 3D TLC flash memory strikes the right balance between endurance and cost. SATA SSDs (with 3D TLC flash) behind USB 3.1 Gen 2 bridges, like the WD My Passport SSD and the LaCie Portable SSD we reviewed here, hit the sweet spot in terms of price, performance, and capacity for the mass market."]},

Over a span of more than a year, Phison delivered numerous updates that brought bug fixes and significant performance changes (not always for the better). The firmware for the Phison E12 was much more mature to begin with; our testing of a pre-release engineering sample showed that the platform was already prepared to compete in the high-end SSD market, so we expect more in the way of subtle refinements than big changes.", "More recently however, Phison's rival Silicon Motion recently re-released their competing SM2262 controller as the SM2262EN with firmware providing a substantially different performance profile that focuses specifically on improving peak performance. So we need to keep an eye on Phison's progress to see how they respond in the short term while preparing their next generation controller ASIC, the Phison E16 that is due to bring PCIe 4.0 support to the retail market by the end of the year.", "Team Group's spec sheet for the MP34 lists the drive as offering fairly typical performance for high-end NVMe SSDs this generation. The random IO performance ratings are similar across all capacities (with random reads actually rated to be slightly faster for the smaller models), but sequential write speeds are highly dependent on drive capacity. Team Group hasn't announced a 2TB version and the warranty period is only three years, so the MP34 is aiming slightly below the top of the market. The write endurance ratings are still competitive with high-end drives that offer five year warranties, so it doesn't appear that Team is really cutting any corners. The shorter warranty period should be little concern if the MP34 is priced appropriately.", "Team Group has opted for a relatively low overprovisioning ratio and consequently higher usable capacities. We're testing a 512GB drive, but there are also 480GB and 500GB Phison E12 drives on the market. At the 1TB capacity these differences in usable capacity don't seem to be strongly influencing performance of E12 drives, but the situation may be different at lower capacities where write performance is more limited. However, so far it looks like the higher usable capacities perform fine and any sacrifices are worth the improvement in price per GB.", "It's hard to keep track of all the Phison E12 SSDs on the market, let alone which firmware version is shipping from each brand (few Phison partners are reliable about delivering aftermarket firmware updates). The ones we've tested are the Corsair MP510 with an early 11.0 firmware, and the Silicon Power P34A80 and Gigabyte Aorus RGB with the 12.1 firmware. These older Phison E12 drives are highlighted in the graphs in this review. Beyond the Phison E12 drives, the most important competitors are Silicon Motion SM2262EN drives like the ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro and HP EX950, and flagship TLC drives from the vertically-integrated major manufacturers: the Samsung 970 EVO Plus and WD Black SN750. We don't have 512GB-class samples for many of those drives, so this review includes a mix of results from current-generation 1TB class drives and year-old 480-512GB drives."]},

The use of 96-layer 3D NAND is especially notable because of how slow other vendors have been to integrate into their own SSDs. The transition from 64L to 9xL NAND (92 for Samsung, 96 for everyone else) started almost a year ago with Toshiba's XG6 SSD for OEMs, but since then everyone has been dragging their heels; manufacturers are reluctant to ramp up 9xL production capacity while flash memory prices are still falling from an oversupply of 64L NAND. Late 2018 and early 2019 saw many vendors refreshing product lines while sticking with 64L NAND, so it's clear that the transition to 9xL NAND won't be complete until sometime in 2020. However, 9xL NAND is slowly finding its way into the marketplace, mostly with OEM products so far.", "Kingston's choice of controller is also interesting, since they've mostly been using Phison controllers in recent years, but for the KC2000 they chose the Silicon Motion SM2262EN rather than the Phison E12. For the past few generations, Phison controllers have been almost exclusively paired with Toshiba NAND while Silicon Motion controllers are mostly used with Intel/Micron NAND. We've been hearing for a while that products in the 96L generation will be mixing things up more, and Kingston is delivering on that. Phison's upcoming E16 controller may win them back if Kingston is willing to cut short the product cycle for the KC2000, because the E16 is on track to be the first consumer SSD controller supporting PCIe 4.0, and it's due to ship before the end of this year. Kingston is also planning to use both Phison and Silicon Motion controllers for their next round of entry-level NVMe SSDs.", "The performance specs of the KC2000 are reasonably high-end, but are not record-setting; in particular, drives using the same SM2262EN controller with Micron 64L NAND have been advertising higher performance across the board. We've found those drives to be highly tuned for peak performance at the expense of sustained performance on heavier workloads, and it will be interesting to see if the firmware for Toshiba NAND behaves the same. The 2TB KC2000 also seems to suffer reduced random IO performance compared to the 1TB model. The power consumption specifications for the KC2000 indicate excellent efficiency for reads (mirroring what we've observed from Toshiba and Western Digital's own NVMe drives using BiCS NAND), but the 7W maximum for writes is alarming given how low the rated write performance is.", "Kingston provides the typical 5-year warranty and 0.3 drive writes per day endurance rating expected from high-end NVMe drives. They're also supporting all the relevant encryption standards, which are relatively uncommon on retail consumer drives, especially in the NVMe market. Kingston is already selling the KC2000 on their website with prices that are a bit on the high side but not as unrealistic as typical launch MSRPs. All four capacities are listed as in stock, so we expect the KC2000 to show up in the usual retail outlets soon.

Several sections now have more in-depth explanations of new and existing features, so the specification is easier to understand even though it has grown from 298 pages for 1.3d to 403 pages for 1.4. Most of the diagrams below are straight out of the spec itself, and are much appreciated.", "As usual, the new features aren't all relevant to all use cases for NVMe SSDs: some only make sense for embedded systems or hyperscaler deployments making heavy use of NVMe over Fabrics and virtualization, and as a result most of the new features are optional for SSDs to implement. The companion standards NVMe Management Interface and NVMe over Fabrics have also been evolving: NVMe-MI 1.1 was ratified in December, and NVMe over TCP has emerged as a third transport protocol for NVMeoF, joining the Fiber Channel and RDMA transports. Some of the additions to the base NVMe specification serve to accommodate changes to these companion standards.", "The new optional features require updates to both the SSDs and the NVMe drivers in operating systems; without support on both sides, drives will fall back to using only older feature sets. Some changes higher up the software stack will also be required in order to make meaningful use of the new capabilities; in particular, many storage administration tools will benefit from being aware of new information and capabilities provided by SSDs. These software updates often take longer to develop than the relevant SSD firmware changes, so support for these new features will be showing up in specialized environments long before they are used by general-purpose OS distributions.", "The NVMe SSD market is at the beginning of a period of major performance improvement enabled by the transition to PCIe 4.0, but this doesn't require any changes to the NVMe spec. The NVMe 1.4 spec does include some performance optimizations that rely on being smarter about how the storage is used, with better cooperation between the SSD and the host system. The other big category of new features pertains to error handling, with particular relevance to RAID rebuilds. Below are highlights from the new specification, but this is not an exhaustive list of what's new, and our analysis of potential use cases may not match what the hardware vendors are planning.", "NVMe SSDs behave like regular block devices with sector sizes that are usually 512 bytes or 4kB. Modern NAND flash memory has native page sizes larger than 4kB, and erase block sizes measured in megabytes. This mismatch is the source of most of the complexity in the flash translation layer implemented by each SSD. The FTL allows software to continue to function correctly with the fiction that their storage has small block sizes, but some awareness of the real block and page sizes can allow the operating system or applications to make the job easier for the SSD and enable higher performance. The NVMe 1.3 spec introduced the Namespace Optimal IO Boundary feature, allowing SSDs to inform the host system of the basic alignment requirements for read and write commands to perform best. We've seen cases of drives that allow small block size access, but have very poor performance for transfers smaller than 4kB:", "In the worst cases, drives should really just be dropping support for 512B sectors and defaulting to 4kB sectors, but where compatibility with older systems is required, hints about what access patterns work well can help. NVMe 1.4 gives SSDs the ability to communicate much more detailed information so that write and deallocate (TRIM) commands can match page and erase block sizes.", "Drives may now report Namespace Preferred Write Alignment and Namespace Preferred Write Granularity values that will minimize the read-modify-write cycles that result from writing to only part of a NAND page. Likewise, the Namespace Preferred Deallocate Alignment and Namespace Preferred Deallocate Granularity apply to NVMe deallocate commands, the analog of ATA TRIM commands. Deallocate/TRIM commands that cover small data ranges or large but misaligned ranges are hard for SSDs to handle without increasing write amplification defeating much of the purpose of using explicit deallocation commands in the first place.", "Drives that support the NVMe 1.3 Streams feature can also provide hints for the preferred write and deallocate granularity when using Streams, and these values will usually be a multiple of the above hints.", "The responsibility for making good use of these hints will mostly fall to the OS and filesystem. RAID stripe sizes and filesystem block sizes can be set based on this information, and applications like databases that try to optimize storage performance by bypassing much of the OS's storage stack should also pay heed.", "NVMe 1.4 introduces several new features to help with handling unrecoverable read errors and corrupted data, especially in RAID and similar scenarios where the host system may be able to recover data more quickly by simply fetching it from somewhere else.", "The ", " feature lets the host system configure how hard the SSD should try to recover corrupted data. SSDs usually have several layers of error correction, each more robust but slower and more power-hungry than the last. In a RAID-1 or similar scenario, the host system will usually prefer to get an error quickly so it can try reading the same data from the other side of the mirror rather than wait for the drive to re-try a read and fall back to slower levels of ECC. NVMe already supports Time-Limited Error Recovery (TLER), but this only allows the host system to put a cap on error handling time in increments of 100ms. Read Recovery Levels allow drives to provide up to 16 different levels of error handling strategies, but drives implementing this feature are only required to implement a minimum of two different modes. This feature is configured on a per- NVM Set level.", "For proactively avoiding unrecoverable read errors, NVMe 1.4 adds Verify and Get LBA Status commands. The ", " is simple: it does everything a normal read command does, except for returning the data to the host system. If a read command would return an error, a verify command will return the same error. If a read command would be successful, a verify command will be as well. This makes it possible to do a low-level scrub of the stored data without being bottlenecked by the host interface bandwidth. Some SSDs will react to a fixable ECC error by moving or re-writing degraded data, and a verify command should trigger the same behavior. Overall, this should reduce the need for filesystem-level checksum scrubbing/verification. Each Verify command is tagged with a bit indicating whether the SSD should fail fast or try hard to recover data, similar to but overriding the above Read Recovery Level setting.", "The ", " feature allows the drive to provide the host with a list of blocks that will probably result in an unrecoverable read error if a read or verify command is attempted. The SSD may have already detected ECC errors during automatic background scanning, or in severe cases it may be able to report which LBAs are affected by the failure of an entire NAND die or channel. The Get LBA Status feature also can be used to ask the drive to perform a scan of selected data ranges before returning the list of probably-unrecoverable blocks.", "When the host system finds out about corrupted or lost data either from the Get LBA Status feature or from issuing read or verify commands and receiving an error in response, it can re-write that data to the same LBAs using a copy obtained elsewhere (backups or RAID recovery) and then carry on using those logical blocks normally, while the SSD will retire the affected physical blocks if necessary.", "Most NVMe SSDs have a substantial amount of DRAM in addition to flash memory. The primary purpose of this DRAM is to serve as a cache for the flash translation layer's tables that track the mapping between logical block addresses and physical flash memory addresses. But NVMe has been exploring other ways to put that DRAM to use. The 1.2 spec introduced the Controller Memory Buffer, which makes some of the SSD's DRAM directly accessible through PCI address space. This allows the IO command submission and completion queues to live in the SSD's memory instead of the host CPU's memory, which can reduce latency on the submission side, and can cut out some unnecessary copying in NVMe over Fabrics situations where peer to peer DMA between the SSD and the network card allows data to bypass the host DRAM entirely. The new Persistent Memory Region (PMR) feature in NVMe 1.4 operates similarly—the host system can read or write to this memory directly using basic PCIe transfers, without any of the overhead of command queues. In practice a Controller Memory Buffer is usually intended to be used in support of normal NVMe operation, but a PMR won't be involved in any of that. Instead, it's a general-purpose chunk of memory that is made persistent thanks to the same power loss protection capacitors that allow a typical enterprise SSD's internal caches to be safely flushed in the event of an unexpected loss of host power. The contents of the PMR will automatically be written out to flash, and when the host system comes back up it can ask the SSD to reload the contents of the PMR.", "The performance and capacity of a PMR won't come anywhere close to what NVDIMMs can provide, but a PMR provides some of the same benefits. Accessing the PMR is much simpler and faster than constructing a NVMe IO command and waiting for its completion. A typical implementation of the PMR feature will be able to accept a very high volume of writes without wearing out any flash memory, because its contents only need to be saved to flash in the event of a power failure. This makes a PMR a great place to store a database or filesystem journal that sees constant writes and can easily become a bottleneck.", "(Lite-On has implemented a similar feature in one of their datacenter SSDs, exposing a portion of its capacitor-protected DRAM as an additional NVMe namespace alongside the regular flash storage namespace. This provides similar performance consistency to a PMR and doesn't require any application or driver changes to support, but the raw performance can't be quite as high as a PMR.)"]},

Kingston had been neglecting this market segment for a while, but the two year old KC1000 has finally been replaced by a proper successor using the latest flash memory and controllers.", "The SSD market is in the midst of two significant-but-protracted transitions. First off, PCIe 4.0 has arrived in one small corner of the market, but so far it offers little aside from increased power usage. Meanwhile the second transition is the move from 64-layer to 96-layer 3D NAND; this is a bit more widespread, but is still moving slowly. Toshiba started shipping their 96L NAND almost a year ago, but in the first half of 2019 we saw more new retail SSDs launch with 64L NAND than with 9xL NAND. Kingston's not the first to use 96-layer 3D TLC in a retail drive, but they're still generally ahead of the curve and have even beat Toshiba and Western Digital to market using their BiCS4 96L NAND.", "The Kingston KC2000 illustrates a broader trend of diversification that we've been seeing signs of with this new generation of flash memory. SSD vendors that don't make their own controllers or NAND are exploring a wider range of options than in recent years. With 32-layer and 64-layer NAND, there was a strong association between Silicon Motion SSD controllers and Intel/Micron NAND, while at the same time Toshiba's 15nm and 64L NAND were mostly used with Phison SSD controllers. (Marvell's presence in the retail consumer SSD market has dropped significantly, and newer controller suppliers like Realtek haven't had much impact.) With the 96-layer generation, Silicon Motion and Phison are both fully supporting multiple NAND vendors, and SSD vendors are trying out the new options.", "Kingston has been a fan of the Phison+Toshiba combinations for quite a while, but the KC2000 pairs Toshiba's 96L NAND with the Silicon Motion SM2262EN controller instead of the Phison E12 or E16 we would have predicted. That gives us the chance to make a very direct comparison between Micron 64L TLC and Toshiba 96L TLC, since we have tested several drives using the SM2262EN controller with the Micron NAND. We already have some idea how Toshiba's 96L NAND compares against their own previous generation thanks to our testing of the XG5 and XG6, but those are OEM-only drives with performance constrained by a somewhat outdated controller. The Kingston KC2000 is one of the first drives to bring Toshiba's 96L NAND to the retail market, and it will be followed by many others over the next year.", "The Silicon Motion SM2262EN controller is a very familiar chip at this point, especially this late in the product cycle. It's a minor update over last year's SM2262 that mostly brings firmware optimizations for improved peak performance. When paired with Micron 64L NAND it has repeatedly proven capable of delivering very high performance for a drive with a PCIe 3 x4 interface., and it's unlikely to be the bottleneck when used with Toshiba's 96L NAND. Kingston's specs for the KC2000 agree: most of the performance ratings are a bit lower than the competition using Micron NAND. The power consumption specs suggest that we may see some of the impressive efficiency that Toshiba/WD BiCS NAND has been providing in first-party drives like the Toshiba XG series and the recent WD Black models.", "The Kingston KC2000 lineup spans from 250GB to 2TB. That smallest capacity point has started to disappear from some flagship high-end product lines because it isn't able to deliver the same level of performance that larger models can. For the KC2000, Kingston is keeping the smallest and most affordable capacity around, but with significantly slower write speed ratings.", "The 5-year warranty and 0.3 DWPD write endurance ratings for the KC2000 are standard for this market segment. The support for TCG Opal and eDrive encryption are still relatively uncommon among retail NVMe drives, and probably result from Kingston's strong focus on the business market.", "Kingston uses a double-sided layout for the KC2000. The DRAM and NAND were binned and packaged by Kingston, and they generally prefer to use more packages with fewer dies each. This means we have eight total NAND packages of 128GB (1024Gb) each and two DRAM packages of 512MB each on our 1TB sample; a tight fit overall, especially compared to the loose ", ".", "The most interesting comparison for the Kingston KC2000 is another drive using the same Silicon Motion SM2262EN controller. For this review, that role is filled by the ADATA SX8200 Pro. The Toshiba XG6 is the only other drive we have so far that uses Toshiba 96L TLC, but it's an OEM-only product. The Silicon Power P34A80 is the representative from the wide field of products that combine Toshiba's 64L TLC with the Phison E12 controller. Also from the Phison camp is Kingston's entry-level NVMe drive, the A1000 that uses the Phison E8 controller and Toshiba 64L TLC.

{"title": "SK Hynix Re-Enters Retail SSD Market, Launches Gold S31 SATA Drives", "paragraph": ["Coming off of the heels of last week’s Flash Memory Summit, today a familiar entity is throwing its hat back into the ring for retail SSDs: SK Hynix. This morning the company is announcing a new line of SSDs, the SuperCore series, which will be sold directly at retail. Kicking off the family will be the Gold S31, a 2.5-inch SATA drive with capacities ranging from 250GB to 1TB.", "At a high level, the retail SSD market has remained an odd hodge-podge of collection of vendors. Many first party NAND manufacturers, such as Samsung, Intel, and Toshiba, all produce their own drives in-house for the consumer market. And, for a time, this included SK Hynix as well, who produced and sold their Canvas series of drives. However, the drives were never officially released in North America, and while they can still be found on the grey market, SK Hynix’s retail ambitions have fallen by the wayside as they’ve remained more focused on selling raw NAND and OEM drives.", "But after essentially being absent from the retail market for the last couple of years, SK Hynix is going to be re-entering it with some new consumer SSDs. Leading off SK Hynix’s revised consumer lineup is their Gold S31 SSD. This is a 2.5-inch SATA SSD, which is based on SK Hynix’s own NAND and SSD controller.", "Unfortunately, SK Hynix isn’t going into a lot of detail about the drive here, so we don’t know which generation NAND and controller they’re using. However there’s a very good chance that this is a retail version of one of their recent OEM drives, as there’s little need to develop a new drive for the retail market, especially the already-overstuffed market for 2.5-inch SATA drives.", "What little we do know is that the drives will come in 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB capacities. And with the SATA interface bottlenecking performance, SK Hynix’s 560MB/sec read and 525MB/sec write speeds are right up there with pretty much every other major SATA SSD. Meanwhile, not listed in the company’s official press release but tucked into the retail listings, these confirm that the drives have DRAM, so the Gold S31 drives appear to be aimed at the mainstream market rather than the budget market and the DRAMless drives that are typically found there.", "Moving down the spec list, the retail listings for the drive also confirm that the 1TB model is rated for 600 TB Written. Spreading this out over the drive’s 5-year warranty period, we end up with 0.3 drive writes per day, both of which are comparable to arch-rival Samsung’s EVO drives.", "All told, while SK Hynix is reentering the retail market, they are still doing so in a fairly conservative manner. The company is starting things off by selling their drives exclusively in North America through Amazon, with plans to expand into Europe and widen their distribution network next year. The company has also mentioned that they’ll have a PCIe drive next year as well, though they aren’t offering any further information on that drive at this time.", "Finally, taking a look at pricing, all 3 Gold S31 drives are already available on Amazon. With the 250GB drive starting at $50 and reaching $124 for the 1TB drive, SK Hynix has launched the drives at a small premium over other mainstream SATA drives. Ultimately, I suspect the company is looking to get some value for its brand name, but given just how competitive and oversaturated the SATA SSD market is, making a dent in the market without joining the race to the bottom in drive prices is going to be difficult task."]},

Those standards have since been put into production by enough vendors to generate a lot of real-world feedback, and it's starting to become clear how the numerous options will fare in the long run. At Flash Memory Summit several companies shared their experiences with the new form factors and explained the motivation behind the changes that have been made to the original EDSFF specs.", "The 3 EDSFF form factors (two lengths and two thicknesses) are the most similar to the existing 2.5 drive form factor, and can be accommodated without overhauling a server's layout. These 3 form factors also seem to be attracting the least interest, and if they see widespread use it will primarily be in more traditional enterprise 2U or 3U server applications where they can take the place of U.2 drives and also replace some uses for PCIe add-in cards. The SFF-TA-1008 spec for the 3 form factors is still sitting at version 1.0, published in March 2018. The most interesting EDSFF 3 device we ran across at FMS this year was a ", ".", "Hyperscalers are much more interested in the benefits of the 1U form factors. The EDSFF 1U Long (abbreviated E1.L) form factor is most similar to Intel's original Ruler concept, and seems best suited for high-density storage. For example, Microsoft Azure is using the 18mm thick E1.L form factor in their Olympus FX-16 1U JBOF, with 16 drives of 16TB each (256TB total) in a 1U OCP chassis that also has PCIe cabling on the front panel. This is pretty much the least dense use case for E1.L drives—the thinner 9.5mm version of E1.L almost doubles the density, at the cost of making cooling more of a challenge.", "The EDSFF 1U Short (E1.S) form factor is shaping up to be more of a general-purpose standard, and has seen the most changes. E1.S was originally conceived as a fairly direct replacement for M.2 that addresses the most important shortcomings of M.2 for datacenter usage: E1.S is a bit wider so that two rows of NAND flash packages can fit on the PCB, it's hot-swappable, and it can accommodate higher power levels thanks to a 12V supply and easier cooling. (This is also the basic summary for ", ".) The E1.S spec originally defined just the PCB dimensions, leaving it up to the vendor to design an appropriate carrier tray or case. In this bare PCB configuration, the maximum power draw was specified as 12W.", "Demand for even higher power use cases has resulted in the definition of standard case and heatsink sizes for E1.S. For cards up to 20W, a 9.5mm thick symmetrical case/heatspreader can be used, making E1.S much more like a shortened version of the fully-enclosed E1.L. For even higher power applications, an asymmetrical case with heatsink has been designed, bringing the thickness all the way up to 25mm and allowing for 25W. The 9.5mm symmetrical case will be adequate for most SSD use cases. The 25mm asymmetrical case+heatsink is intended more for non-SSD devices such as accelerators that dissipate most of their power from a single large chip. These new options allow E1.S to support the same power (and performance) levels possible with 2.5 U.2 drives, while being significantly easier to cool.", "To accommodate these high-power devices, the E1.S form factor now also allows for 8 PCIe lanes using one of the longer connector variants that was already permitted for E1.L and the 3 form factors. Several vendors at Flash Memory Summit were showing off devices using the E1.S form factor with the asymmetrical heatsink: a mix of SSDs and accelerators."]},

At first, this converter was demoed on small interposer boards that sit between standard U.2 SSDs and an Ethernet-capable backplane. This year, Marvell and Toshiba showed off a fully integrated Ethernet SSD that adds the Marvell 88SN2400 converter to Toshiba's existing SSD design. Mechanically, this drive appears to be a 2.5 U.2 or U.3 SSD, but electrically its host interface is a pair of 25Gb Ethernet links instead of four PCIe lanes.", "", "These drives have not been formally launched by Toshiba as a shipping product, but they were described as production-ready and were demonstrated in a 24-drive 2U Ethernet JBOF appliance built by Aupera. A typical NVMe JBOF either uses PCIe switches and external PCIe cabling to a few nearby servers, or it contains one or two x86 server CPUs, some PCIe switches from Broadcom or Microsemi and some RDMA-capable Ethernet NICs from Mellanox to provide NVMe over Fabrics functionality. The Ethernet JBOF ditches all of that for one of Marvell's own Ethernet switch ASICs.", "Taking things to the logical next step, Marvell also announced a native Ethernet/NVMeoF SSD controller.

This new single-chip solution for Ethernet-attached SSDs helps cut costs and power consumption, making the whole idea more palatable to datacenter customers. Marvell showed samples of this controller paired with 8TB of Toshiba 96L 3D TLC NAND and 12GB of DDR4 DRAM.", "Looking further into the future, Marvell shared their take on the idea of Computational Storage—SSDs that do more than just store data. Marvell is working to integrate a Machine Learning engine into future SSD controllers, allowing inferencing tasks to be offloaded from CPUs or GPUs onto the SSDs that already store the data being processed. The hardware setup is basically the same mess of cables connecting FPGAs to Flash that Marvell has shown in previous years, but on the software side their demo has matured greatly.", "In addition to demonstrating realtime object recognition using a pre-trained model, Marvell now has a system to perform offline recognition on videos stored on the SSD. Their demo presented the results of this recognition as a graph showing which objects were recognized over the duration of a video. There was also a content-aware search engine that would return the segments of stored videos that depict the requested objects. For the demo, this functionality was exposed through a simple web interface. In production, the envisioned use case is to have an application server aggregating results from an array of content-aware SSDs that each perform some kind of analytics on their share of the overall dataset."]},

Furthermore, even when fully equipped, the facility is not expected to add any new wafer capacity, but rather will be used to house more advanced process equipment necessary for greater numbers of 3D NAND layers.", "As the number of 3D NAND layers increases, each wafer has to spend more time inside chemical vapor deposition (CVD) machines, meaning it takes longer to etch them. Adding more time still, various extravagant production techniques like string stacking lengthen manufacturing require even more steps. In order to keep the number of wafers processed consistent as the number of 3D NAND layers grows, flash memory producers have to add extra CVD and etching machines to cleanrooms, which requires extra space.

Details about these new models have been slow to come out, but Samsung is now talking about three major improvements they bring over earlier SSDs in addition to the raw performance increases enabled by PCIe 4.0. The list of improvements includes fail-in-place (FIP) technology to boost reliability of drives, SSD virtualization technology to guarantee consistent performance for VDI and similar use cases, as well as V-NAND machine learning technology to predict and verify characteristics of NAND cells.", "Samsung’s fail-in-place (FIP) technology promises to allow the SSD to robustly handle hardware failures that would otherwise be fatal to the SSD, up to the failure of an entire NAND die. For the highest-capacity 30.72TB PM1733, the drive can keep running more or less normally even with the loss of any one of its 512 NAND flash dies. The drive will scan for corrupted or lost data, reconstruct it and relocate it to a still-working flash chip, and continue to operate with high throughput and QoS. In essence, this is like a RAID-5/6 array running in degraded mode instead of the whole array going offline. It's still wise to eventually replace a SSD after it suffers such severe malfunction, but Samsung's FIP technology means that replacement can be done at the operator's convenience instead of the problem causing immediate downtime.", "The addition of fail-in-place doesn't change the fact that the PM1733 and PM1735 have write endurance ratings of 1 and 3 drive writes per day, respectively. The overall lifespan is still comparable to the previous generation of drives, but the chance of a premature death due to causes other than normal NAND wear has been greatly reduced.", "Next up, Samsung has added virtualization technology to the PM1733 and PM1735 SSDs. Samsung has implemented the optional NVMe virtualization features based on Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), allowing a single NVMe SSD controller to provide numerous virtual controllers (up to 64 in the case of Samsung's drives). Each virtual controller can be assigned to a different VM running on the host system, and provide storage to that VM with no CPU overhead—the same as if the entire drive had been assigned to a single VM with PCIe passthrough. Storage capacity on each SSD can be flexibly allocated to different namespaces that can in turn be attached to the relevant virtual controller.", "The third technology introduced by Samsung is V-NAND machine learning. The company does not disclose precise details about how they are making use of machine learning, but only says that it is used to predict and analyze characteristics of flash cells, including by detecting variations among circuit patterns. With 3D NAND, it is increasingly difficult to get by with one size fits all strategies for cell programming, reading and error correction. Even tracking the P/E cycles each block has been through isn't enough; there can be significant variation between layers near the top and bottom of the 3D stack, and from one die to another. Samsung is hardly alone in turning to machine learning strategies to tackle these complexities. The new capability will ensure consistent performance and improved reliability of today’s drives powered by TLC V-NAND, but its importance will grow dramatically in the case of ", ".", "The first drives that can take advantage of the new features are already shipping to interested parties.

Only a handful of products have launched using the new 9x-layer 3D NAND, and there's been just one major new SSD controller launch so far in 2019. The whole industry is gearing up for the PCIe 4.0 transition, but it's off to a slow start. That gives us the chance to fill in some gaps in our SSD coverage by taking a closer look at several drives that we were unable to review at launch. This is the first in a series of reviews that will look at drives that aren't brand new but are still worth a second look.", "First up is the TeamGroup L5 LITE 3D, a SATA drive that was consistently on the leading edge of last year's price drops and remains within a few dollars of the cheapest products currently available. The L5 LITE 3D was one of the first drives to cross some notable price thresholds: less than $20 for 120GB, $30 for 240GB, $50 for 480GB and $100 for 960GB. It's not staying below those levels all the time, but it's also not going more than a few weeks without going on sale. Given the pricing and the lite in its name, one could easily assume that it is an entry-level DRAMless product, but it actually uses the more mainstream Silicon Motion SM2258 controller platform with a full-sized DRAM cache. Team has even gone with a nice full metal case instead of using plastic or cheaping out on the connectors as we saw with the ", ", so the product as a whole doesn't give the impression that it was subjected to rigorous cost-cutting measures.", "It appears that the secret to Team's aggressive pricing on this model boils down to two main factors: a 3-year warranty that's more typical of entry-level drives than mainstream drives, and using whatever memory is cheapest at the moment. We've seen reports of up to four different variants of the L5 LITE 3D in the wild, as distinguished by their firmware version. Given that the L5 LITE 3D's price has dropped by more than 60% since it was introduced, that many revisions isn't as ridiculous as it might seem at first glance. We don't appreciate when mainstream SSDs make major BOM changes without changing the model name, but it's more forgivable for an entry level drive, especially when the SATA bottleneck limits the performance impact that changing NAND can have.", "Our 480GB sample reports firmware version Q0410A and based on the serial number it appears to have been manufactured in late October 2018. The DRAM on the drive is Micron DDR3 but the sole NAND package bears Team's logo rather than that of one of the NAND manufacturers. That NAND package also bears the marking DHCM80A1, but that doesn't shed much light on whose NAND lies beneath. It's possible this drive was built with lower-grade flash memory, but either way we didn't detect any new errors during our testing. The write endurance rating of just over 0.2 DWPD for 3 years is definitely lower than mainstream SATA drives.", "For this review, we're primarily focusing on comparing the L5 LITE 3D against other TLC SATA drives of similar capacity. The Mushkin Source is fairly typical of recent DRAMless SATA SSDs and uses the DRAMless variant of the same Silicon Motion controller that Team is using. The Crucial MX500 and SanDisk Ultra 3D are mainstream SATA drives from two of the top tier brands. We've also thrown in results from an entry-level NVMe SSD (MyDigitalSSD SBX), Team's high-end NVMe SSD (MP34), and the Samsung 860 PRO to show the current limits of what a premium SATA SSD can achieve."]},

Their entry-level client NVMe efforts have been concentrated around their BG series SSDs that are a complete SSD in a single BGA package (optionally mounted on a small M.2 card).", "On the whole, these sort of small form factor SSDs have become increasingly popular with laptop and 2-in-1 tablet manufacturers, who are looking for an edge on size and power consumption, but still want the manufacturing advantage of on-card SSDs that can be easily swapped. Dropping a single-package SSD onto a removable card allows them to capture both benefits, with only a slight size penalty over directly soldering the SSD down. The end result is that these small SSDs are increasingly appearing in major laptops, such as Microsoft's Surface Laptop 3, and we don't expect it to stop there, as OEMs will increasingly turn to these small, highly integrated SSDs.", "Within Toshiba's product lineup, the ", " was the first and only member of their BG series product line to get a retail counterpart, in the form of the ", ". The newer BG4 isn't getting the same treatment, so Toshiba sampled the OEM drive itself to show off the major advances with this generation. That means the product we're reviewing today will be difficult for consumers to get their hands on except by buying the right laptop or tablet, but the BG4 is still important and worth a look because it shows where the client SSD market is headed.", "When M.2 SSDs first came onto the scene for client/consumer computing, the market was split between SATA and PCIe versions, but almost everything was using the 22x80mm card size. Now, M.2 SATA is almost as dead as mSATA and PC OEMs are going all-in on NVMe. But they're not sticking with just the 2280 size; the shorter card sizes and even single-package BGA SSDs are becoming more common. 3D NAND flash memory is now dense enough that typical consumer storage capacities (1TB and less) can be achieved with a single stack of NAND dies. From there, it's not too much harder to move the controller die into the same package as well. It's not currently possible to deliver high-end performance in such small form factors due to thermal limitations, but even entry-level NVMe performance is a big step up from SATA or eMMC.", "", "Smaller SSD form factors are an inconvenience to consumers looking for aftermarket storage upgrades, but for PC OEMs the advantages are compelling.

At the moment, the BG4 seems to be a popular choice for similarly thin and light systems, and in some cases it may be the only user-upgradable component. Toshiba has well-established relationships with major OEMs and a track record of reliably supplying good SSDs at competitive prices. In this product segment, they have few serious competitors (Samsung and WD).", "The BG4 is the most significant update in the history of this product line. It makes the switch from 64L to 96L TLC NAND, which enables a 1TB model for the first time. The controller underneath the stack of NAND flash dies has also been updated and now features four PCIe lanes instead of two. Together, these changes make the BG4 much more suitable for mainstream storage duties and help the BG series climb out of its low-performance/low-capacity niche. Given the small form factors, the BG4 still has a much stronger emphasis on low power than most NVMe products, and that prevents it from reaching the same performance levels as high-end consumer NVMe SSDs that use the much larger M.2 2280 card size.", "Inside the BG4's single BGA component is a stack of 3D NAND dies and the controller die, but no DRAM. To mitigate the usual performance penalties of a DRAMless SSD, the BG4 uses the NVMe Host Memory Buffer (HMB) feature to give the SSD exclusive access to a portion of the host system's DRAM. This buffer isn't used to store any user data and instead is a cache for the drive's internal metadata: the mappings between logical block addresses used by software and the physical locations where the data is stored. When reading or modifying data already stored on the drive, it's much quicker for the SSD to look up the physical location of that data using a DRAM cache than to perform extra reads from the flash memory.", "A mainstream SSD with its own DRAM usually has 1GB of DRAM for each 1TB of flash, but NVMe SSDs using HMB only allocate a few tens of MB of host DRAM. That's enough to cache mapping information for tens of GB of user data, which is large enough to cover most consumer access patterns. HMB primarily benefits random IO, and usually has a larger impact on writes than reads.", "The Toshiba/Kioxia BG4 is the first 1TB HMB-enabled SSD we have tested. We have previously tested the older 480GB Toshiba RC100 (retail counterpart to the BG3), and the 500GB HP EX900 that uses Silicon Motion's DRAMless SM2263XT NVMe controller. Western Digital's WD Blue SN500 is the retail counterpart to their SN520 OEM SSDs that compete directly against Toshiba's BG series, but at only 250GB our SN500 sample is simply too small to fairly compare against the 1TB BG4. Samsung's PM981(a) BGA SSDs are notable for including DRAM in addition to the controller and NAND flash, but it's hard to get review samples of Samsung OEM drives.", "To round out our comparisons, this review also includes results from a mix of other SSDs in different product segments. Toshiba's XG6 sits above the BG4 in their client OEM SSD product stack, but it uses the same 96L TLC NAND flash memory.

The 512GB model won't be happening at all. The 512GB 660p was much more susceptible to the performance downsides of QLC NAND than the larger models, and given the pricing of 512GB-class TLC-based drives, it's reasonable for QLC product lines to start with a minimum of 1TB.", "The 665p continues to use the Silicon Motion SM2263 NVMe SSD controller, with a small DRAM cache and a massive variable-size SLC cache:", "The switch to 96L QLC has enabled minor performance improvements.

This is still an entry-level NVMe SSD that could get by just fine with a mere PCIe 3.0 x2 connection even though it supports an x4 link. As usual, these specs are for burst performance where the SLC cache is in use; post-SLC write speeds are still slower than what any vendor wants to put on a spec sheet. When Intel announced the 665p in September, they showed CrystalDiskMark results for the 660p vs the 665p that cast the 665p in a much better light, but their numbers for the 660p were suspiciously low.", "Much more important than the performance changes is the write endurance boost the 665p brings compared to the 660p.

Quite a few other budget drives use Silicon Motion 4-channel controllers like the SM2258XT, and they don't seem to have any trouble competing on cost with drives using smaller 2-channel controllers.", "Part of Realtek's overall SSD controller strategy is an emphasis on reducing the need for external DRAM on the SSD; the performance penalties that come from having little or no DRAM are partially offset by including larger buffers on the controller itself, but the precise amount has not been disclosed.", "The ADATA SU750 uses Micron 64L 3D TLC NAND flash memory, the same as most of ADATA's current SSD models. ADATA does their own binning and packaging of NAND, and it appears that the SU750 gets pretty good quality flash: the write endurance ratings are roughly 0.7 drive writes per day for the 3-year warranty period, equivalent to about 0.4 DWPD over 5 years. This is slightly higher endurance than quite a few of ADATA's own SSDs that come with 5-year warranties. If anything, we usually expect DRAMless SSDs to get lower endurance ratings due to less effective wear leveling.", "The use of a DRAMless, two-channel controller doesn't hurt the sequential IO specs for the SU750, but it does lead ADATA to give it lower random IO performance ratings than mainstream drives that can saturate the SATA link.

The SN500 used the same PCB layout as the OEM SN520, which kept all the components within the first 30mm of the M.2 card, even though the SN500 is sold only as a M.2 2280 card rather than the variety of lengths the SN520 is available in.  ", "The SN500 impressed us with much better performance than we expected from a DRAMless NVMe SSD, and the power efficiency was also pretty good. The SN550 promises better performance enabled by a move up to four PCIe lanes, allowing sequential transfer speeds to now hit 2.4GB/s compared to 1.7GB/s for the SN500. That higher performance will drive power consumption up a bit, but considering that the SN500 rarely exceeds 2W, that's not a big problem for the SN550. However, WD is giving the SN550 an improved thermal design that appears to consist of just moving the NAND flash package to the far end of the M.2 card rather than keeping it right next to the controller. Even though the SN550 adds a 1TB option that the SN500 lacked, it still uses only one NAND flash package. That means that at least the 1TB model has to be using Western Digital's 512Gb TLC NAND dies.", "The WD Blue SN550 comes with the usual 5-year, 0.3 DWPD warranty, which is as good as can be expected for an entry-level drive.

The use of 512Gb instead of 256Gb dies cuts costs slightly, but is usually avoided on high-end drives because having fewer dies limits the degree of parallelism available to the SSD controller. This isn't a problem for the 1TB SX6000 Pro since the four-channel controller is a bigger limitation. Since the 256GB and 512GB models of the SX6000 Pro don't have severely curtailed performance specs, ADATA may have made the smart choice to use the 256Gb dies on at least the smallest model.", "For SATA SSDs, the lack of a DRAM cache pretty much always condemns a drive to have extreme low-end performance. For NVMe SSD, going DRAMless doesn't carry such a harsh penalty and entry-level NVMe SSDs usually have no trouble offering better real-world performance than mainstream SATA SSDs with DRAM caches. This is often achieved with the help of the NVMe Host Memory Buffer feature that lets the SSD borrow a chunk of the host system's DRAM (64 MB in the case of this drive) to use as a cache for the drive's internal data structures used for managing the flash memory.

The manufacturing transitions to 96-layer 3D NAND and beyond are not going to increase bit output as quickly as demand will be growing. This will be a major change from the NAND oversupply that caused price crashes in 2018 and into 2019.", "SSD controller vendor Phison is betting that increasing prices will finally push the consumer SSD market to embrace 4 bit per cell QLC NAND flash memory, which thus far has seen only limited success in the retail SSD market and virtually no adoption from PC OEMs. The price premium for SSDs with 3 bit per cell TLC NAND has been small or non-existent across all market segments, so the performance and endurance advantages of sticking with TLC NAND have been worthwhile. Those days may be coming to an end. Phison expects—quite reasonably—that when NAND flash memory supplies are constrained the bulk of the TLC NAND manufactured will be snatched up by the higher-paying enterprise SSD customers, more or less forcing the consumer SSD market to start shifting toward using QLC as the mainstream option.", "In preparation for this shift, Phison is making sure that their full controller lineup is ready to work with QLC NAND. That means tuning the controller firmware to make the best of the lower performance of TLC NAND. For the OEM market in particular, they also have to update any of the older controllers whose error-correction capabilities aren't up to the task of supporting a 5-year warranty with the lower endurance of QLC.", " hasn't changed significantly from what we reported on after Flash Memory Summit. What is changing is how these controllers are being marketed. Phison has taken the unusual step of publishing performance specifications for most of their SSD controllers when paired with QLC NAND, rather than sticking with the TLC-based numbers that cast their controllers in a better light. Unfortunately, we're still getting numbers that are mostly based on testing at high queue depths and with durations short enough that the SLC cache is primarily what's being measured.", "When paired with QLC NAND, Phison's high-end NVMe controllers will now be using a full-range dynamic SLC cache size, similar to what we've seen with recent Silicon Motion controllers but quite different from how existing TLC-based Phison NVMe drives have behaved with small fixed-size SLC caches. Maximizing the SLC cache size reduces the odds of ever running out of cache during ordinary consumer use, but at the cost of a more drastic performance penalty when the cache does fill up: there's more SLC data that needs to be compacted into TLC/QLC, and less free TLC/QLC to work with when doing that compaction in the background while continuing to handle host IO commands. This tradeoff makes the most sense when using QLC NAND, because no matter how big or small the SLC cache is, things will be painfully slow should it ever run out.", "The performance of Phison's current high-end NVMe controllers with QLC NAND will be quite a bit slower than the best achievable performance with TLC NAND. The reduction in random read performance will probably have the greatest impact. This is also where we see a requirement for much higher drive capacities in order to attain the best performance. Over the past two years, 1TB TLC-based SSDs have become quite affordable and are almost always large enough to offer the maximum performance a SSD controller can handle. If those price points have to switch over to QLC NAND this year, we'll see 1TB drives at a significant disadvantage compared to 2TB and 4TB models. Since NAND price increases will make it harder for consumers to jump up to higher capacities, we may see a real performance regression for the average mainstream consumer SSD, without any monetary savings as a consolation prize.", "Over on the SATA side, things don't look so bad. With the current S12 mainstream SATA controller and the full-range dynamic SLC caching strategy, even 1TB of QLC is still sufficient to hit the highest top-line performance numbers possible behind a 6Gbps bottleneck. Phison is listing those same peak performance numbers for capacities from 1TB all the way up to 16TB, including the non-power of two intermediate capacity of 12TB. In the past, those higher capacities have been supported only for the sake of enterprise SSDs, but Phison says they have at least one partner planning to bring out a 16TB drive for the consumer/prosumer retail market.", "Phison's latest DRAMless SATA controller (S13T) will still be using fixed-size SLC caches when paired with QLC NAND, and low-cost drives that have to offer lower capacities will be stuck with subpar performance—again with random reads suffering the most.", "Phison did not provide QLC-based performance projections for their current E13T DRAMless NVMe controller or its upcoming replacement E19T that brings PCIe 4.0 support and other performance increases. They also didn't provide QLC performance for the E18 (their 12nm second-generation high-end PCIe 4.0 controller), but that controller is due much later in the year and it should still be used mostly with TLC for enthusiast-class drives, unless the NAND price situation gets really bad.", "As usual for performance projections from SSD controller vendors, the numbers are subject to change between now and retail availability of drives. The choice of which particular QLC NAND is used in a given product will affect performance, and there's still time for further firmware optimizations.", "At CES 2020, Phison demonstrated various combinations of QLC NAND with their controllers in a range of capacities. Most of the SSDs shown were using Micron 96L QLC, but a few were also using Toshiba/Kioxia BiCS4 (96L) QLC. The QLC preparations also carried over to Phison's portable storage products, where they showed a 1TB MicroSD card, an 8TB Thunderbolt 3 SSD, and several USB attached solutions. All of these reference designs are likely to come to market this year, and in the portable storage market the QLC transition will probably be more thorough and unavoidable."]},

For PCIe 4.0, Silicon Motion will replace those with the high-end SM2264 8-channel controller and the more mainstream SM2267 4-channel controller. Thanks to supporting much faster NAND interface speeds, the SM2267 should be able to offer performance comparable to current-generation 8-channel controllers, which means most of the extra bandwidth provided by the upgrade to PCIe 4.0 will go unused by the SM2267. Still, at 4GB/s for sequential reads, 3GB/s for sequential writes, and 400k IOPS for random IO, this is not by any measure a low-end solution. ADATA will be using the SM2267 in the XPG Pearl.", "ADATA's drive using the Silicon Motion SM2264 will be the XPG Indigo.

Those minor increases in top-line performance numbers relative to the XPG Indigo won't matter to real-world consumer usage, and whether the Sage or Indigo is the better overall performer may come down to which controller architecture offers better performance at low queue depths.", "The release dates for ADATA's upcoming PCIe 4.0 SSDs have not been set, and it's not yet clear whether the Innogrit or Silicon Motion solutions will be ready to ship first. Of the three new drives, only the Innogrit-based Sage was featured in live demos at ADATA's CES 2020 exhibit. It appears unlikely that any of them will ship until around Computex (June) at the earliest.

They are planning a profound change to how consumer SSDs work, ditching drive-managed SLC caching in favor of host-managed tiered storage.", "Enmotus is a well-established provider of storage management software. Their most familiar product to consumers is probably FuzeDrive, a limited edition of which is bundled with recent generations of AMD motherboards as ", ". This serves as AMD's answer to Intel's ", " and ", " storage caching systems. Enmotus also has enterprise-oriented products in the same vein. Their new MiDrive technology builds on their existing tiering software to manage a combination of SLC and QLC NAND on a single consumer SSD.", "All software-driven caching or tiering solutions tend to have limited consumer appeal due to the complexity of setting up the system. At least two physical drives are required, and the OS needs to load an extra driver to manage data placement. Any compatibility issue or other glitch can easily render a PC unbootable, and data recovery isn't as straightforward as for a single drive. These hurdles don't scare off enthusiasts and power users, but PC OEMs aren't eager to market and support these configurations. But without some form of caching or tiering, consumer SSDs would be limited to the raw performance of TLC or QLC NAND. SLC caching managed transparently by the SSD's firmware has been adopted by almost all consumer SSDs in order to improve burst performance, and it has proven to be very effective for consumer workloads. The fundamental limitation of this strategy is that the SSD must work with limited information about the nature and purpose of the user data it is reading and writing.", "Most SSDs rely on fairly simple procedures for managing their SLC caches: sending all writes to the cache unless it's full, and using idle time to fold data from SLC into more compact TLC representation, freeing up cache space for future bursts of writes. There are still some choices to be made in implementing SLC caching for consumer SSDs: whether to use a fixed-size cache or dynamically sized, and whether to stall when the cache fills up or divert writes straight to TLC/QLC. As QLC drives become more common, we're also seeing drives that prefer to keep data in the SLC cache long-term until the drive starts to fill up, so that the cache can help with read performance in addition to write performance.", "Host-managed caching or tiering opens the door to more intelligent management of data placement, since the host OS has better information: about which chunks of data belong to what file, and about the processes and users that interact with those files. It is easier for the host OS to accurately track the history of access patterns for hot vs. cold files. It is also possible to expose manual control of data placement directly to the user.", "The Enmotus MiDrive technology allows one SSD to present the host with access to two separate pools of flash storage: QLC and SLC managed by the same SSD controller. To implement this, they have partnered with Phison to modify SSD controller firmware. For server products, a single NVMe SSD would expose two separate NVMe namespaces that Linux treats as different block devices. But for consumers, Enmotus has chosen to maximize backwards compatibility by having the MiDrive present itself as a single block device, with the first 32 or 64 GB initially mapped to SLC NAND and the rest of the drive mapped to QLC NAND. This makes it possible (and fast!) to install an OS to a MiDrive without needing any special Enmotus software or drivers. Once the Enmotus driver has been loaded, it takes over the management of data placement using vendor-specific commands that instruct the SSD to promote or demote ranges of Logical Block Addresses (LBAs) between the QLC and SLC pools of flash. (The initialization process for this tiering currently takes about a quarter of a second, because very little data needs to be moved until there's history indicating what should be in QLC vs SLC.)", "This is a lot simpler for the host side than the strategy Intel uses for their ", ", which is two separate PCIe devices on one M.2 card and requires special motherboard support to properly detect both halves before the caching software can even get involved. Enmotus is working to make MiDrive even simpler by having Microsoft distribute the Enmotus driver with Windows, so that a MiDrive will be automatically detected and managed by the Enmotus software without requiring any user intervention. For now, Windows will default to using its standard NVMe driver for a MiDrive, but that should change by the time products hit the shelves.", "", "Enmotus supports assigning data to SLC or QLC in 4MB chunks, which is probably the size of a single NAND flash erase block in SLC mode, and thus the smallest chunk size that can easily be remapped between the QLC and SLC portions of the drive without contributing to unnecessary write amplification. That 4MB block size means that a small file moved to SLC is likely to bring along other nearby files, which will often contain related data that may also benefit from being in SLC. It also means that large files can be partially resident in SLC and partially in QLC. Since this process doesn't change the logical block addresses a file occupies, Enmotus MiDrive doesn't need to change anything about how NTFS organizes data, and it doesn't need to behave like an advanced disk defragmenter that tries to move important data toward the beginning of the disk. The MiDrive software only needs to look up what LBAs are used by a file and tell the SSD whether to move that data to SLC or QLC blocks. The only side-effect visible to the rest of the OS is a change in the performance characteristics for accessing that part of the SSD.", "The SLC portion of an Enmotus MiDrive differs from a traditional SLC cache not only by being host-managed, but also in how the SSD treats it for wear leveling purposes. A typical SSD's SLC cache may have a static or dynamic size, but in either case when new write commands arrive the SSD will write the data to whatever NAND flash block is currently empty. When the cache is flushed, data from several SLC blocks will be rewritten in TLC or QLC mode to a different empty block, and the SLC blocks are then free to be erased and put back into the pool of available blocks. Managing just one pool of empty blocks means that the actual physical location of the SLC cache can move around over time, and a block that was last used as TLC might end up being used as SLC the next time data is written to it.", "By contrast, Enmotus MiDrive technology has the SSD track two entirely separate pools. When the drive is manufactured, the SLC portion is permanently allocated for the lifetime of the drive. Any physical NAND pages and blocks that are used as SLC will always be treated as SLC for the lifetime of the drive, and the same for the QLC portion. The two pools of flash are subject to completely independent wear leveling, even though SLC and QLC portions will exist side by side on each physical flash chip on the drive. This means that the QLC blocks will never be subjected to the short-term Program/Erase cycles of SLC cache filling and flushing. For the SLC blocks, the error correction can be tuned specifically to SLC usage, and that allows Enmotus to achieve around 30k Program/Erase cycles for the SLC portion of the drive (based on Micron QLC NAND). MiDrives will expose separate SMART indicators for the SLC and QLC portions of the drive, so monitoring software will need to be updated to properly interpret this information.", "In principle, it would be possible for either the SLC or QLC portion of the drive to be worn out prematurely, but in practice Enmotus is confident that their tiered storage management software will lead to longer overall drive lifespans than drive-managed SLC caching. Files that are known to be frequently modified will permanently reside on SLC and not be automatically flushed out to QLC during idle time. If the Enmotus software is smart enough, it will also be able to determine which files should skip the SLC and go straight to QLC until it becomes clear that a file is frequently accessed. For example, a file download coming into the machine over gigabit Ethernet will not initially need SLC performance because raw QLC can generally handle sequential writes at that speed (especially with no background SLC cache flushing to slow things down). And if that file is a movie which is infrequently accessed and only read sequentially, there's no reason for it to ever be promoted up to SLC. In general, the tiered storage management done by Enmotus should result in less data movement between SLC and QLC, rather than the increased write amplification that traditional SLC caching causes.", "Since the SLC portion of an Enmotus MiDrive is a slice carved out of regular QLC NAND, it cannot offer all the benefits of specialized low-latency SLC NAND like ", " or ", ". The SLC portion of a MiDrive won't be appreciably faster than the SLC cache of a traditional consumer SSD, but that performance will be more consistent and predictable when working with files that are kept entirely on the SLC portion of the drive.", "Enmotus MiDrive is currently implemented as a combination of Windows driver software and custom SSD firmware for Phison NVMe controllers, but it does not require any custom hardware. This means that any vendor currently selling Phison E12 NVMe SSDs can make a MiDrive-based product by licensing and shipping Enmotus firmware. PC OEMs can adopt MiDrives by switching to drives with Enmotus firmware and ensuring that they either include the Enmotus drivers in their Windows images, or relying on them to be distributed through Windows Update. No motherboard firmware or hardware modifications are required, or any changes to the process of provisioning a machine and preparing it for delivery to the end user. Enmotus is engaging both with PC OEMs and vendors of retail SSDs, so we can expect pre-built systems with Enmotus MiDrive technology and and upgrade options usable on any Windows 10 PC that already supports standard M.2 NVMe SSDs. Enmotus is optimistic about uptake from PC OEMs, expecting MiDrive to get a much better reception than Intel's Optane H10 did.", "The basic MiDrive products will be fully automatic, with the Enmotus driver pre-installed or installed automatically when a MiDrive is detected. Data placement decisions will be completely behind-the-scenes. For enthusiasts, there will also be a premium tier similar to their current FuzeDrive software, which includes Windows Explorer shell integration so that individual files can be manually promoted or demoted, either permanently or for a limited period of time. Enmotus will also be providing a drive health monitoring tool that will include their estimate for how much extra drive lifetime has been won by using their tiering instead of ordinary SLC caching.", "Enmotus expects SSDs with MiDrive technology to mostly use either 32GB or 64GB SLC portions and offer total capacities from about 400GB up to around 2TB, but the exact configurations will be determined by what their partners want to bring to market. Enmotus is also planning enthusiast-oriented solutions supporting RAID-0 style striping across multiple physical drives, and solutions for single-package BGA SSDs that go into small form factor and embedded devices.", "Enmotus MiDrive technology will add to the price of SSDs, but since we're talking about QLC storage that's only relative to the cheapest NVMe SSDs available, and the final sticker prices will still be competitive for consumer SSDs. In return for that, users should get better real-world performance and enough effective write endurance to justify a 5-year warranty. We're looking forward to testing out this technology later this year, even though it will further complicate our benchmarking process. Enmotus is already sampling to interested OEMs."]},

All of these new models will feature WDC's first energy-assisted recording technology which they have dubbed ePMR.

The new generation of capacity enterprise HDDs will be Western Digital's first to use three-stage actuators for faster and more precise seeks. Very roughly, this is akin to giving the arms elbow and write joints. This is not to be confused with multi-actuator drives that allow the heads for some platters to move independently from the heads for other platters. Seagate has been making more noise about dual-actuator hard drives and their potential to significantly improve the IOPS/TB figures that have been in decline, but Western Digital is also working on multi-actuator drives—they just haven't shared plans for bringing them to market.", "The flash memory side of Western Digital is currently focused more on delivering incremental improvements rather than introducing major technological changes.

Now Western Digital's updated projections acknowledge that SMR went basically nowhere in 2019 an will do the same for 2020, but they are adamant that it will begin to take off in 2021. Several things need to change about the current situation before that can happen.", "First, SMR hard drives need to have compelling advantages. Western Digital promises that the capacity gap between CMR and SMR drives will widen in the coming years, though they stop short of promising that SMR will have a significant advantage in $/TB. Even at comparable $/TB, larger drives can provide a lower TCO for large deployments by reducing the number of servers needed to hit a certain capacity point. This is an argument Western Digital has been making to push their larger CMR drives as well:", "", "The other big change necessary for SMR to succeed is that the performance penalties need to become more manageable. SMR drives are fundamentally unable to support random writes. They need to buffer and write an entire track at a time, and tracks that overlap can only be rewritten in-order. Drive-Managed SMR HDDs let the host system pretend those restrictions don't exist by using large write caches. Western Digital believes the best way to get good performance out of SMR drives is to instead do Host-Managed SMR where software is aware of the restrictions on writes within a shingled zone. This obviously requires major changes to the software stack, and according to WDC this is what's been holding back adoption of SMR in the datacenter. Western Digital has been putting in a lot of work to help prepare the software ecosystem for SMR hard drives, and they believe that by 2021 they will have major customers will be ready to roll out SMR-aware software as part of a mass deployment of SMR drives.", "The data access pattern restrictions imposed by SMR hard drives are eerily similar to some of the fundamental challenges of working with NAND flash memory's small page vs huge erase block structure. For the past year, Western Digital has been promoting their Zoned Storage Initiative that seeks to address both of these challenges at once and allow applications to deal generically with zoned storage devices, be they SSDs or SMR HDDs. The ATA and SCSI command sets already have extensions for host-managed SMR. WDC has been helping NVMe develop the Zoned Namespace (ZNS) extension to provide a similar interface to SSDs.", "For hard drives the benefits of SMR are small but due to get bigger. For SSDs, switching to a zoned model can allow for drastically smaller overprovisioning ratios and onboard DRAM, so drives can be cheaper while offering similar performance on many workloads. Properly host-managed IO can also significantly reduce write amplification, allowing for higher effective write endurance.", "Western Digital is already shipping the ", " that provides some of those advantages without using the upcoming ZNS extension, by having the Flash Translation Layer work with 32kB blocks rather than 4kB. Like a drive-managed SMR HDD, this means the SN340 will allow the host to issue random write commands, but performance for those will suck. Thus, the SN340 is targeted only at the most read-intensive workloads. A ZNS SSD would more likely deal with zone sizes on the order of tens of megabytes rather than 32kB, and would require the host system to ensure its writes are sequential within each zone to avoid the horrible random write performance.", "The NVMe Zoned Namespace extension is likely to be ratified this year.

So what is a user or system builder to do if they need a drive with SLC-like performance all the time? For a while, the answer to that has been MLC drives, but with MLC slowly but surely on its way out as well, other solutions are needed.

The higher performance enabled by 24G SAS means the PM6 can require more power than its predecessors—now up to 18W, though the drive can be configured to throttle to lower power levels ranging from 9W to 14W.", "The PM6 SAS family is available in three endurance tiers: the 1 DWPD and 3 DWPD models closely correspond to CM6 NVMe models, but only the SAS product line gets a 10 DWPD tier. Maximum capacities are 30.72 TB in the 1 DWPD series, 12.8 TB in the 3 DWPD series and 3.2 TB in the 10 DWPD series. Kioxia said that 4 TB class drives are still the most popular, but this will probably be shifting toward the 8 TB models over the next year or so. The 30.72 TB models will remain more of a niche product in the near future, but they expect demand for those capacities to start picking up in 2021 or 2022. Detailed performance specifications for each model are not yet available.", "SAS in general is still a growing market both in terms of number of units and bits shipped and is projected to continue growing for at least a few more years, even though NVMe is gradually taking over the enterprise SSD market. Kioxia's customer base for SAS SSDs has been divided between storage array vendors and the traditional enterprise server market. The storage array market has been quicker about migrating to NVMe so this may be the last generation of SAS SSDs to see significant adoption in that market segment. SAS will be hanging around in the enterprise server market for a lot longer, helped in part by the backwards-compatibility with SATA hard drives for cheap high-capacity storage, and the straightforward traditional RAID solutions as compared to the challenges with NVMe RAID. The server market typically doesn't make as much use of the dual-port capability of SAS drives, so the speed boost from 24G SAS will be particularly welcome there, allowing drives to now reach about 2.3GB/s each rather than about 1.1GB/s on 12Gb SAS.", "The Kioxia PM6 SAS SSDs are now available for customer qualification and evaluation. The drives have already been validated with 24G SAS host controllers from both Broadcom and Microchip (Microsemi/Adaptec)."]},

Samsung's second-generation QLC NAND is now ready, and the 870 QVO is the first 870 model to be launched.", "The industry put a lot of effort into preparing for the arrival of QLC NAND: beefing up error correction to compensate for lower write endurance, and tuning cache algorithms on consumer drives to forestall dealing with lower performance after SLC caches run out. But in spite of all the work it took to make QLC SSDs viable, they haven't made much of a splash and definitely aren't displacing TLC from the market yet.", "The new Samsung 870 QVO SSDs arrive into a market landscape that doesn't look all that different to what the 860 QVO faced at the end of 2018. Samsung is no longer the only brand selling consumer SATA SSDs with QLC NAND, but it's not a big club. Most of the other QLC SATA drives are so low-end that the manufacturers won't commit to using any particular memory inside, and they're using whatever is cheapest at the moment. Some months, there's more to be saved by going with a DRAMless controller and TLC NAND that fell off the back of a truck, rather than using Samsung's strategy of pairing theoretically cheaper QLC NAND with a solid controller.", "QLC NAND has had a bit more of an impact in the NVMe SSD market, where a few more brands are experimenting with using QLC to make ", " drives cheaper, rather than simply making cheap drives even cheaper. That's the same goal that Samsung had for the 860 QVO and now the 870 QVO: bringing multi-TB SSDs into the mainstream. Samsung's most visible contribution to that goal will be the introduction of the first 8TB consumer SATA SSD: the 8TB 870 QVO. That model is due to arrive a little bit later in August, and we don't have a sample yet. Today, we're looking at the 1TB and 4TB capacities of the 870 QVO.", "The Samsung 870 QVO is an incremental update to the 860 QVO. The QLC NAND has been updated from Samsung's 64-layer V-NAND to their 92-layer V-NAND. For their NVMe product line, this change produced the 970 EVO Plus as a successor to the 970 EVO without even updating the controller, and the 970 PRO didn't get updated at all. The 870 QVO does bring a controller update, replacing the MJX with the MKX in Samsung's long line of SATA SSD controllers. Samsung hasn't disclosed any particular enhancements to their controller or firmware architecture, and we suspect this iteration is a more minor update than the last one. We know that the older MJX controller was already capable of supporting 8TB drive capacities, so that wasn't the driving force for this controller update.", "Samsung continues to provide more detailed performance specifications than any other consumer SSD vendor. The big top-line numbers that everybody reports are hardly worth mentioning for a SATA drive; almost any drive can saturate the 6Gbps interface under ideal conditions, with random or sequential reads or writes at a high enough queue depth. Samsung goes the extra mile to provide specs for performance at queue depth 1, and performance after the SLC cache runs out. Some of those numbers look pretty brutal: sequential write speeds dropping to a mere 80MB/s for the 1TB model, and even random reads are considerably slower when accessing QLC data rather than the SLC cache. But overall, these specs are very similar to the 860 QVO. Random write performance at QD1 appears to have taken a bit of a hit, but everywhere else performance for the 870 QVO is rated to be equal or slightly better than its predecessor.", "The 870 QVO product line still starts at 1TB, the minimum size needed to put 8 controller channels to work when using 1024Gbit NAND dies. That smallest capacity model comes with some significant performance deficits relative to the multi-TB models, in much the same fashion as 256GB TLC drives fall behind their larger counterparts, or 512GB capacities for high-performance NVMe SSDs. The most notable limitations of the 1TB 870 QVO are the post-cache write speed of 80 MB/s compared to 160 MB/s, and the cache size that is almost halved. Together that means the 1TB model is more at risk of exhibiting unacceptable performance when the SLC write cache runs out, but at 42GB this model's cache can still handle more writes than many users perform in an entire day of desktop usage.", "Samsung's warranty for the 870 QVO is 0.3 drive writes per day for 3 years. This is comparable to many low-end consumer TLC drives and a step up from most other consumer QLC drives that are rated for 0.1 to 0.15 DWPD (sometimes over a 5-year warranty period, but that's still fewer total writes than the 870 QVO is rated for).", "Introductory MSRPs for the 870 QVO are reduced from what the 860 QVO debuted at, with $50 off the 2TB and $100 off the 4TB. But that merely puts the 870 QVO's launch MSRP on par with the current street prices for the 860 QVO. And because it's Samsung, the pricing isn't low enough to rule out comparing against mainstream TLC SATA SSDs and entry-level NVMe SSDs, especially for the lower capacities.", "In a way, that's good for this review, because the 870 QVO doesn't have much direct competition in the form of other large QLC SATA drives. Most of the SSDs that are considerably cheaper than the 860/870 QVOs are DRAMless SSDs, usually TLC but occasionally QLC. The cheapest entry-level NVMe SSDs are all either DRAMless with TLC, or use QLC with a more mainstream controller.", "For this review, we are comparing the 870 QVO against the following:", "We don't have any non-Samsung 4TB consumer SSDs to compare against; the Western Digital Blue is pretty much the only other 4TB consumer SATA SSD, and Sabrent's Phison E12-based Rocket and Rocket Q drives are the current options on the NVMe side. The rest of the 4+ TB SSD options are enterprise drives that lack SLC caching and idle power management and are way more expensive than anything else this review is looking at.", "Ultimately, most of the competition against multi-TB SSDs comes from hard drives, the incumbent alternatives for high-capacity drives. Multi-TB hard drives are still vastly cheaper than multi-TB SSDs, but for many consumers the big question posed by drives like the 870 QVO is whether it's reasonable yet to move all their storage over to solid-state. That doesn't necessarily require SSDs to match hard drives on a $/GB basis, because there are plenty of advantages to SSDs that are worth paying at least a bit extra for.", "Representing the hard drive market, we have a Western Digital WD Red 4TB, the pre-SMR WD40EFRX model.

This is quite similar to the extensions SAS and SATA have added to accommodate Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) hard drives, with a few extras for SSDs. ‘Zoned’ SSDs with this new feature can offer better performance than regular SSDs, with less overprovisioning and less DRAM. The downside is that applications and operating systems have to be updated to support zoned storage, but that work is well underway.", "The NVMe Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) specification has been ratified and published as a Technical Proposal. It builds on top of the current NVMe 1.4a specification, in preparation for NVMe 2.0. The upcoming NVMe 2.0 specification will incorporate all the approved Technical Proposals, but also reorganize that same functionality into multiple smaller component documents: a base specification, plus one for each command set (block, zoned, key-value, and potentially more in the future), and separate specifications for each transport protocol (PCIe, RDMA, TCP).

The long-lived standard of 512-byte sectors was chosen merely for convenience, and enterprise drives now support 4K byte sectors as we reach drive capacities in the multi-TB range. By contrast, a flash memory chip has several levels of structure baked into the design. The most important numbers are the page size and erase block size. Data can be read with page size granularity (typically on the order of several kB) and an empty page can be written to with a program operation, but erase operations clear an entire multi-MB block. The substantial size mismatch between read/program operations and erase operations is a complication that ordinary mechanical hard drives don't have to deal with. The limited program/erase cycle endurance of flash memory also adds to challenge, as writing fewer times increases the lifespan.", "Almost all SSDs today are presented to software as an abstraction of a simple HDD-like block storage device with 512-byte or 4kB sectors. This hides all the complexities of SSDs that we’ve gone into detail over the years, such as page and erase block sizes, wear leveling and garbage collection. This abstraction is also part of why SSD controllers and firmware are so much bigger and more complicated (and more bug-prone) than hard drive controllers. For most purposes, the block device abstraction is still the right compromise, because it allows unmodified software to enjoy most of the performance benefits of flash memory, and the downsides like write amplification are manageable.", "For years, the storage industry has been exploring alternatives to the block storage abstraction. There have been several proposals for Open Channel SSDs, which expose many of the gory details of flash memory directly to the host system, moving many of the responsibilities of SSD firmware over to software running on the host CPU. The various open channel SSD standards that have been promoted have struck different balances along the spectrum, between a typical SSD with a fully drive-managed flash translation layer (FTL) to a fully software-managed solution. The industry consensus was that some of the earliest standards, like the ", ", exposed too many details, requiring software to handle some differences between different vendors' flash memory, or between SLC, MLC, TLC, etc. Newer standards have sought to find a better balance and a level of abstraction that will allow for easier mass adoption while still allowing software to bypass the inefficiencies of a typical SSD.", "Tackling the problem from the other direction, the NVMe standard has been ", " that allow drives to share more information with the host about optimal patterns for data access and layout.

Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) is a technique for increasing storage density by partially overlapping tracks on hard drive platters. The downside of this approach is that it's no longer possible to directly modify arbitrary bytes of data without corrupting adjacent overlapping tracks, so SMR hard drives group tracks into zones and only allow sequential writes within a zone. This has severe performance implications for workloads that include random writes, which is part of why drive-managed SMR hard drives have seen a mixed reception at best in the marketplace. However, in the server storage market, host-managed SMR is also a viable option: it requires the OS, filesystem and potentially the application software to be directly aware of zones, but making the necessary software changes is not an insurmountable challenge when working with a controlled environment.", "The zoned storage model used for SMR hard drives turns out to also be a good fit for use with flash, and is a precursor to NVMe Zoned Namespaces.

We see that the two sides of the My Passport SSD clamshell are held together by industrial-strength double sided tape. Prying apart the two at the seam was relatively painless - in fact, it was the easiest portable SSD to take apart (out of all the ones that I had worked on earlier). The SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD v2's top segment holds on to the bottom segment using a series of plastic clips in the inside perimeter - this is straightforward to take out using opening picks. Selected pictures are available in the gallery below.", "Inside the unit, we see that a thermal pad right across the M.2 SSD (in the Extreme v2 teardown) and another on the reverse side (in the My Passport SSD teardown).

While most DAS units targeting a particular market segment advertise similar performance numbers and also meet them for common workloads, the real differentiation is brought out on the technical side by the performance consistency metric and the effectiveness of the thermal solution. Industrial design and value-added features may also be important for certain users. The remaining sections in this review tackle all of these aspects after analyzing the features of the drives in detail.", "Prior to looking at the usage characteristics of the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD v2 and the WD My Passport SSD (2020), it is helpful to compare their specifications against other similar SSDs.", "The two SSDs have the shortest supplied cable lengths at 15cm.

The most common usage scenario is transfer of large amounts of photos and videos to and from the unit. Other usage scenarios include the use of the DAS as a download or install location for games and importing files directly off the DAS into a multimedia editing program such as Adobe Photoshop. Some users may even opt to boot an OS off an external storage device.", "The AnandTech DAS Suite tackles the first use-case. The evaluation involves processing three different workloads:", "Each workload's data set is first placed in a 25GB RAM drive, and a robocopy command is issued to transfer it to the DAS under test (formatted in NTFS). Upon completion of the transfer (write test), the contents from the DAS are read back into the RAM drive (read test). This process is repeated three times for each workload. Read and write speeds, as well as the time taken to complete each pass are recorded. Bandwidth for each data set is computed as the average of all three passes.", "It can be seen that there is no significant gulf in the numbers between the different units. For all practical purposes, the casual user will notice no difference between them in the course of normal usage.However, power users may want to dig deeper to understand the limits of each device. To address this concern, we also instrumented our evaluation scheme for determining performance consistency.", "Aspects influencing the performance consistency include SLC caching and thermal throttling / firmware caps on access rates to avoid overheating. This is important for power users, as the last thing that they want to see when copying over 100s of GB of data is the transfer rate going down to USB 2.0 speeds.", "In addition to tracking the instantaneous read and write speeds of the DAS when processing the AnandTech DAS Suite, the temperature of the drive was also recorded at the beginning and end of the processing. In earlier reviews, we used to track the temperature all through. However, we have observed that SMART read-outs for the temperature in NVMe SSDs using USB 3.2 Gen 2 bridge chips end up negatively affecting the actual transfer rates. To avoid this problem, we have restricted ourselves to recording the temperature at either end of the actual workloads set. The graphs below present the recorded data.", "The first three sets of writes and reads correspond to the photos suite. A small gap (for the transfer of the video suite from the internal SSD to the RAM drive) is followed by three sets for the video suite. Another small RAM-drive transfer gap is followed by three sets for the Blu-ray folder. An important point to note here is that each of the first three blue and green areas correspond to 15.6 GB of writes and reads respectively. The consistency shown across different passes of the same workload show that no thermal throttling is at play for either SSD. The thermal solution in both perform very similarly for normal workloads - around 3C-4C rise in temperature after around 250GB of reads and writes.", "There are a number of storage benchmarks that can subject a device to artificial access traces by varying the mix of reads and writes, the access block sizes, and the queue depth / number of outstanding data requests. We saw results from two popular ones - ATTO, and CrystalDiskMark - in a previous section. More serious benchmarks, however, actually replicate access traces from real-world workloads to determine the suitability of a particular device for a particular workload. Real-world access traces may be used for simulating the behavior of computing activities that are limited by storage performance. Examples include booting an operating system or loading a particular game from the disk.", "PCMark 10's storage bench (introduced in v2.1.2153) includes four storage benchmarks that use relevant real-world traces from popular applications and common tasks to fully test the performance of the latest modern drives:", "Despite the data drive benchmark appearing most suitable for testing direct-attached storage, we opted to run the full system drive benchmark as part of our evaluation flow.

This points to an all-round performance, while other competing SSDs are optimized for one type of workload only.", "The performance of the drives in various real-world access traces as well as synthetic workloads was brought out in the preceding sections. We also looked at the performance consistency for these cases. Power users may also be interested in performance consistency under worst-case conditions, as well as drive power consumption. The latter is also important when used with battery powered devices such as notebooks and smartphones. Pricing is also an important aspect. We analyze each of these in detail below.", "Flash-based storage devices tend to slow down in unpredictable ways when subject to a large number of small-sized random writes. Many benchmarks use that scheme to pre-condition devices prior to the actual testing in order to get a worst-case representative number. Fortunately, such workloads are uncommon for direct-attached storage devices, where workloads are largely sequential in nature. Use of SLC caching as well as firmware caps to prevent overheating may cause drop in write speeds when a flash-based DAS device is subject to sustained sequential writes.", "Our ", " configures the device as a raw physical disk (after deleting configured volumes). A ", " workload is set up to write sequential data to the raw drive with a block size of 128K and iodepth of 32 to cover 90% of the drive capacity.

The My Passport SSD (2020) starts off with similar speeds as the Extreme v2, and stays there for around 15 seconds (~13GB of write data), before dropping down to around 670 MBps (which is sustained throughout the workload). The temperature does end up at 76C (21C delta). Normally, one would assume that the 13GB change-over is the effect of SLC caching, but the absence of the cliff in the Extreme v2 points to something else -  the SanDisk Extreme v2 has a little higher thermal capacity compared to the My Passport SSD (2020). This allows a slightly higher bump up in performance for the former. In other words, Western Digital is more proactive in throttling the My Passport when there is a possibility of rapid temperature rise.", "Bus-powered devices can configure themselves to operate within the power delivery constraints of the host port. While Thunderbolt 3 ports are guaranteed to supply up to 15W for client devices, USB 2.0 ports are guaranteed to deliver only 4.5W (900mA @ 5V). In this context, it is interesting to have a fine-grained look at the power consumption profile of the various drives. Using the Plugable USBC-TKEY, the bus power consumption of the drives was tracked while processing the CrystalDiskMark workloads (separated by 30s intervals). The graphs below plot the instantaneous bus power consumption against time, while singling out the maximum and minimum power consumption numbers.", "The two SSDs clock in between 2.1W and 5W for the workloads. These are not the most power efficient external SSDs, as the Samsung T7 Touch operates between 0.6W and 4W for the same workloads. These numbers are fine for usage with desktops and high-performance notebooks, but the aspect needs to be kept in mind when using them with mobile phones and tablets.", "The price of flash-based storage devices tend to fluctuate quite a bit over time. However, the relative difference between different models usually doesn't change.

The verdict on the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD v2 can be given only after the street pricing is known. That said, even if it were to be $200, we can say that the performance and consistency are worth it.", "After careful analysis of various aspects (including benchmark numbers, temperatures, power consumption, and pricing), it is clear that the WD My Passport SSD (2020) and the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD v2 are both excellent choices for a wide variety of applications. However, as the adage goes - one can't have the cake and eat it too. Both SSDs deliver the performance and consistency at the cost of increased power consumption and slightly high temperatures. Optimizing for those metrics would mean losing out on the aspects that deliver instant gratification - getting transfers done quickly without any throttling. However, those very metrics might turn out to be of key concern in certain scenarios. Therefore, the right choice depends on the use-case. Based on our tests, the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD v2 effectively serves the needs of content creators who need to use it in the field (thanks to its carabiner loop, IP55 rating, and 2m drop protection). The WD My Passport SSD (2020) is a better fit for the casual home / business user.", "The SanDisk Extreme PRO Portable SSD (2019) model continues to be our favorite / recommended portable SSD as long as it is not EOL-ed. The use of a high-end SSD (non-DRAM-less) and a better thermal solution in the unit ensures that it surpasses the SanDisk Extreme v2 and the My Passport SSD across all metrics except for power consumption.

And the core of the company’s NAND efforts, their longstanding IMFT joint-venture with Micron, ", " when the two companies announced that they would stop jointly developing flash memory.", "Since then, Intel has largely been walking its own path, securing the #5 spot in the NAND industry (generally right behind #4 SK Hynix) and releasing new products, but struggling with the commodity nature of the NAND business. While Intel’s Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG) as a whole brought in $4.4B in revenue for 2019, the group has lost money for 4 of the last 5 years, recording flat or negative operating incomes. Only in the last six months has Intel made any real money off of NAND, reporting $600M in operating income for the first half of 2020. So although NSG – and by large part, Intel’s NAND business – have played a big part in Intel’s record revenues, they haven’t turned a significant profit for a company that’s renowned for their 60% gross margins.", "", "Meanwhile for SK Hynix, the Intel deal opens the door to some new opportunities, and it also helps formerly fourth-place company company scale up to deal with the competition of its three remaining rivals, Samsung, Kioxia/WD, and Micron. ", " that once this deal closes, SK Hynix will become the second-largest vendor of NAND, with over 20% market share, placing it behind market leader (and rival Korean firm) Samsung. Like many other commodity component markets, the NAND flash market has been subject to wild swings in profitability and the resulting pressure to consolidate, so by picking up Intel’s NAND business, SK Hynix will be in a stronger position going forward.", "But the real pearl for SK Hynix is Intel’s enterprise SSD business, which the company specifically calls out in its joint press release. Despite its overall modest size, Intel’s NAND business has a major presence in the enterprise SSD market thanks to its early investment there as well as its domination of enterprise CPU sales. Intel’s chief (and arguably only serious) competitor in this space has been Samsung, so acquiring Intel’s SSD business makes SK Hynix that much more capable of going toe-to-toe with their biggest rival.", "", "Long term, however, it remains to be seen what SK Hynix will do with the NAND fab side of Intel’s business. While it’s clear that they have big plans for SSDs and intend to leverage Intel’s existing market share and customer relationships – which is a big part of why they’re acquiring that segment first – SK Hynix doesn’t necessarily need Intel’s NAND manufacturing technology. SK Hynix is plenty capable of building more fabs on its own if it wanted more raw NAND capacity, and indeed the company has ", ". Meanwhile the companies’ technologies are significantly different, as Intel relies on floating gate tech while SK Hynix uses charge trap tech. So although the two technologies have their trade-offs, it’s very questionable whether SK Hynix wants to continue developing both over the long run.", "And for both parties, the long run really is the key. NAND flash is still facing a likely dead-end in the long run, as NAND has been scaled down almost as small as it can go before leakage becomes a serious problem. 3D NAND stacking has given NAND a second wind in the interim, but there’s only so far that can go, especially in respect to reducing bit costs. Which is a big part of the reason why Intel developed 3D XPoint to begin with, as the technology doesn’t suffer the same scalability restrictions. So although Intel is getting out of the NAND game, they are still very much in the storage game over the long run, now focused on a non-volatile memory technology that is expected to scale much further in the future.", "Speaking of the future, Intel has also stated that they will be investing the expected proceeds from the sale into some of their other non-core, forward-looking businesses. Intel’s 5G, AI, and edge efforts are all slated to benefit from the sale, and all are markets that Intel is priming for potentially extreme growth over the coming years.", "In the interim, however, the next step will be up to regulators. SK Hynix’s acquisition will need the approval of American, South Korean, and Chinese regulators, which the companies expect to take around a year – and at which point SK Hynix can start the actual acquisition. Meanwhile Intel is set to announce its Q3 earnings this Thursday, at which point we may hear a bit more about the deal from Intel’s perspective. SK Hynix’s own earnings call will follow in a couple of weeks, on November 3", ".", "Source: "]},

These controllers have been on the roadmap for quite a while and have been previewed at trade shows, but the first models are now shipping. The high-end SM2264 and mainstream SM2267/SM2267XT controllers will enable consumer SSDs that move beyond the performance limits of the PCIe 3.0 x4 interface that has been the standard for almost all previous consumer NVMe SSDs.", "The high-end SM2264 controller is the successor to Silicon Motion's SM2262(EN) controllers, and the SM2264 brings the most significant changes that add up to a doubling of performance. The SM2264 still uses 8 NAND channels, but now supporting double the speed: up to 1600MT/s. The controller includes four ARM Cortex R8 cores, compared to two cores on SMI's previous client/consumer NVMe controllers. As with most SSD controllers aiming for the high end PCIe 4.0 product segment, the SM2264 is fabbed on a smaller node: TSMC's 12nm FinFET process, which allows for substantially better power efficiency than the 28nm planar process used by the preceding generation of SSD controllers. The SM2264 also includes support for some enterprise-oriented features like SR-IOV virtualization, though we probably won't see that enabled on consumer SSD products. The SM2264 also includes the latest generation of Silicon Motion's NANDXtend ECC system, which switches from a 2kb to 4kB codeword size for the LDPC error correction.", "The SM2264 controller will be competing with in-house controllers used by Samsung and Western Digital for their flagship consumer SSDs, and against the upcoming Phison E18 controller. Phison's E16 controller was the first consumer PCIe 4.0 controller to hit the market, but is now being outclassed by a second wave of PCIe 4.0 controllers that come much closer to using the full potential of a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface. The SM2264 controller is currently sampling to drive vendors, but we don't have an estimate for when products will be hitting the shelves.", "For the more mainstream product segments, Silicon Motion's SM2267 and SM2267XT controllers are the replacements for the SM2263 and SM2263XT. These will help bring entry-level NVMe performance up to about the level that used to be standard for high-end PCIe 3.0 SSDs. The SM2267XT is the DRAMless variant of the SM2267 and also has half as many chip enables (CEs), which allow for a much smaller package size suitable for use on small form factors like M.2 2230. The SM2267(XT) controllers are still manufactured on the cheaper 28nm process. The SM2267 and SM2267XT controllers are in mass production and the first products using those parts have also entered the supply chain: we already have a sample of ADATA's Gammix S50 Lite with the SM2267 controller on our test bench.", "The SM2267 will be competing against a mix of older 8-channel controllers like the Phison E12, and newer 4-channel solutions as seen in the SK hynix Gold P31. We expect this to be the most important consumer SSD product segment going into 2021 as these drives will not carry the steep price premium currently seen on high-end 8-channel PCIe 4.0 SSDs, and they'll still be plenty fast for almost all use cases. The DRAMless SM2267XT variant will be competing against controllers like the Phison E19T for entry-level NVMe SSDs that carry little or no price premium over SATA drives. These low-cost NVMe controllers are also increasingly popular for portable SSDs; the performance increases of the SM2267XT over the SM2263XT will not matter for drives using 20Gb/s USB to NVMe bridge chips, but will be helpful for Thunderbolt SSDs."]},

Other usage scenarios include the use of the DAS as a download or install location for games and importing files directly off the DAS into a multimedia editing program such as Adobe Photoshop. Some users may even opt to boot an OS off an external storage device.", "The AnandTech DAS Suite tackles the first use-case. The evaluation involves processing three different workloads:", "Each workload's data set is first placed in a 25GB RAM drive, and a robocopy command is issued to transfer it to the DAS under test (formatted in NTFS). Upon completion of the transfer (write test), the contents from the DAS are read back into the RAM drive (read test). This process is repeated three times for each workload. Read and write speeds, as well as the time taken to complete each pass are recorded. Bandwidth for each data set is computed as the average of all three passes.", "The Rocket Nano Rugged comes in the middle of the pack - the Crucial X8 with QLC flash is optimized for read-intensive workloads, and it easily comes out on top in all the read segments. For writes, the OWC Envoy Pro EX USB-C consistently edges out the Rocket Nano Rugged. That said, it can be seen that the gulf in the numbers between the different units is not very significant. For all practical purposes, the casual user will notice no difference between them in the course of normal usage. However, power users may want to dig deeper to understand the limits of each device. To address this concern, we also instrumented our evaluation scheme for determining performance consistency.", "Aspects influencing the performance consistency include SLC caching and thermal throttling / firmware caps on access rates to avoid overheating. This is important for power users, as the last thing that they want to see when copying over 100s of GB of data is the transfer rate going down to USB 2.0 speeds.", "In addition to tracking the instantaneous read and write speeds of the DAS when processing the AnandTech DAS Suite, the temperature of the drive was also recorded at the beginning and end of the processing. In earlier reviews, we used to track the temperature all through. However, we have observed that SMART read-outs for the temperature in NVMe SSDs using USB 3.2 Gen 2 bridge chips end up negatively affecting the actual transfer rates. To avoid this problem, we have restricted ourselves to recording the temperature at either end of the actual workloads set. The graphs below present the recorded data.", "The first three sets of writes and reads correspond to the photos suite. A small gap (for the transfer of the video suite from the internal SSD to the RAM drive) is followed by three sets for the video suite. Another small RAM-drive transfer gap is followed by three sets for the Blu-ray folder. An important point to note here is that each of the first three blue and green areas correspond to 15.6 GB of writes and reads respectively. There is no evidence of throttling at play - in fact, the behavior in terms of instantaneous drops in the write rates is similar to that of the Extreme PRO v2 from SanDisk. The OWC Envoy Pro EX USB-C maintains the best performance consistency. On the temperature side, the Rocket Nano Rugged has the steepest rise - a 10C difference between the starting and ending values. When the compact nature of the drive is considered, this doesn't sound too bad. In any case, the ending temperature (absolute value) is not a huge concern.", "There are a number of storage benchmarks that can subject a device to artificial access traces by varying the mix of reads and writes, the access block sizes, and the queue depth / number of outstanding data requests. We saw results from two popular ones - ATTO, and CrystalDiskMark - in a previous section. More serious benchmarks, however, actually replicate access traces from real-world workloads to determine the suitability of a particular device for a particular workload.

The latter is also important when used with battery powered devices such as notebooks and smartphones. Pricing is also an important aspect. We analyze each of these in detail below.", "Flash-based storage devices tend to slow down in unpredictable ways when subject to a large number of small-sized random writes. Many benchmarks use that scheme to pre-condition devices prior to the actual testing in order to get a worst-case representative number. Fortunately, such workloads are uncommon for direct-attached storage devices, where workloads are largely sequential in nature.

Beyond that, the drive has three performance levels averaging around 400 MBps, 350 MBps, and 280 MBps. The Crucial X8 with a similar drive capacity has 10x the SLC cache (around 256GB), but its direct-to-QLC write is around 150 MBps. The Rocket Nano Rugged is better consistency-wise, though we would have appreciated a larger amount of SLC cache in the drive. Unfortunately for the Rocket Nano Rugged, the OWC and SanDisk drives on the same interface can sustain direct-to-TLC write rates matching that of the maximum practical input write rate (i.e, signs of SLC caching are not evident in the sequential write performance consistency test). The temperature at the end of the stress test (65C) was similar to the ones obtained for the Crucial X8 and the SanDisk Extreme PRO v2. The OWC Envoy PRO EX USB-C has the best thermal design of the lot.", "Bus-powered devices can configure themselves to operate within the power delivery constraints of the host port. While Thunderbolt 3 ports are guaranteed to supply up to 15W for client devices, USB 2.0 ports are guaranteed to deliver only 4.5W (900mA @ 5V). In this context, it is interesting to have a fine-grained look at the power consumption profile of the various drives. Using the Plugable USBC-TKEY, the bus power consumption of the drives was tracked while processing the CrystalDiskMark workloads (separated by 30s intervals). The graphs below plot the instantaneous bus power consumption against time, while singling out the maximum and minimum power consumption numbers.", "The DRAM-less nature is an advantage for the Rocket Nano Rugged here, with the drive recording the lowest peak power consumption of all four considered drives. The idle power at 1.26 is reasonable, though not as low as the 0.86W of the OWC Envoy Pro EX USB-C drive.", "The price of flash-based storage devices tend to fluctuate quite a bit over time. However, the relative difference between different models usually doesn't change. The table below summarizes the product links and pricing for the various units discussed in the review.", "The Sabrent Rocket Nano has a very reasonable price in terms of the cost per GB - at approximately 16 cents per GB, it is the most economical of the TLC drives in the mix.", "After careful analysis of various aspects (including benchmark numbers, temperatures, power consumption, and pricing), it is clear that the appeal of the Sabrent Rocket Nano Rugged is not in the performance numbers, but the unique nature - To the best of our knowledge, there is no other 2TB external SSD equipped with 3D TLC flash with a footprint as small as that of the Rocket Nano Rugged. The industrial design is also attractive, though that is a subjective metric. Sabrent has opted for some tradeoffs to achieve the cost and compact sizing - a DRAM-less internal SSD had to be used, and that pulls down the performance numbers compared to other 2TB drives in the market. For normal consumer workloads and casual usage, this drawback might not be a factor to consider at all. The IP67 rating and rugged nature further enhance the appeal of the drive - the OWC Envoy Pro EX USB-C also has a IP67 rating, but it is priced significantly higher.", "The thermal profile of the Sabrent Rocket Nano is good enough to prevent it from getting too hot to touch. In any case, the rubber bumper ensures that the hot metal casing is never a problem for handling.

Those drives are mostly designed for the storage appliance and traditional server markets, using the well-established 2.5 SSD form factor, supporting a broad range of capacities and endurance tiers and offering advanced features like dual-port support and multiple namespaces. The new XD6 series focuses more specifically on the hyperscale datacenter market and is based on a new controller architecture that is separate from that used in the CD6/CM6/PM6 family, but includes the same upgrade to 96L 3D TLC NAND flash memory.", "Driven by the needs of hyperscalers like Facebook, the XD6 is tuned more for power efficiency than raw single-drive performance. The capacity options are more limited, and only one endurance tier (1 DWPD) is offered. Many of the more advanced reliability features like dual-port support and multiple sector sizes including Protection Information have been omitted, reflecting the fact that hyperscale datacenters apply the cattle, not pets mindset to entire racks or more—redundancy is managed in software on a broader scale, and it's not cost-effective at that scale to treat individual drives as mission-critical.", "Compared to the previous-generation XD5 SSDs, the most obvious and significant change the XD6 brings is the switch from M.2 22110 and 2.5/7mm U.2 form factors to EDSFF E1.S. The introduction of EDSFF to Kioxia's product line with the XD6 was hinted at in their ", ", but we didn't expect it to be such an aggressive transition: the M.2 option has been dropped and the 2.5 U.2 version will be launching after the EDSFF versions.", "Hyperscalers are the main driving force behind the new EDSFF family of form factors, and within that market segment the EDSFF form factors are catching on quite well. Transitioning to PCIe Gen4-capable platforms also provides a convenient opportunity to adopt a new form factor that combines the density of M.2 with the hot-swappability and higher power support of U.2 drives. The XD6 uses the E1.S form factor (1U height, short length) with three different thicknesses: 9.5mm with a heatspreader case, and 15mm or 25mm with different heatsink sizes. All three versions of the XD6 use the same PCB and offer the same performance and power consumption; the different thickness options primarily trade off between density and airflow requirements.", "The combined effects of PCIe 4.0 support, newer NAND flash memory, and a new form factor supporting higher power levels mean the XD6 is dramatically faster than the preceding XD5. Sequential performance is up by a factor of 2.5, random IO performance is up by a factor of four. But power draw has only doubled, from 7W to 14W—so the XD6 is clearly not sacrificing any power efficiency to deliver this improved performance.", "The XD6 was designed to comply with an Open Compute Project (OCP) ", ". This standard sets performance and power targets and requires many features that are declared optional by the base NVMe specification but are valuable for hyperscale datacenter usage. The XD6 is currently in qualification with big customers like Facebook but general availability is still months away. (Not that there's much demand for EDSFF drives yet outside of the hyperscale segment, given the very limited options for purchasing servers with PCIe 4.0 E1.S slots.)", "As mentioned above, Kioxia's high-end enterprise and datacenter product lines have already been updated this year and are still near the beginning of what are usually the longest product cycles in the whole lineup. The CM6 and CD6 added U.3 support with backwards compatibility with U.2 ports, but those two families and the PM6 SAS SSDs are still using the familiar 2.5/15mm form factor. The CD6 and the new XD6 are splitting the datacenter segment, with the CD6 serving as the 2.5 option and the XD6 as the EDSFF E1.S option.", "The decision to drop the lowest 960GB capacity option from the XD series means the XD6 is even less suitable than the XD5 for server boot drive usage. Kioxia has also marketed the client XG series for this purpose, but those drives lack power loss protection and are thus considered unsuitable by many customers (unless used in a system with provisions for off-drive power loss protection). This is a small but important product segment, with currently very few options offering the ideal combination of low capacity, small form factor (M.2 2280 instead of 22110) and power loss protection. Kioxia is at least considering developing a drive for this segment, but if they do we won't be seeing it anytime soon.", "Kioxia's HK6 is the end of the road for their enterprise/datacenter SATA products and won't be getting a successor, but Kioxia hasn't quite discontinued it yet.

We haven't heard much new about low-end client/consumer SSDs. UNH-IOL's NVMe Integrator's List shows the AG1 as a M.2 2230 or BGA SSD, so that's possibly a BG series replacement.

{"title": "QLC Goes To 8TB: Samsung 870 QVO and Sabrent Rocket Q 8TB SSDs Reviewed", "paragraph": ["Flash memory prices have been on a downward trajectory for years. A decade ago, this trend was helping SSDs establish a foothold in the consumer market—largely for enthusiasts. Now, SSDs have taken over as the default storage medium for consumer PCs and further advances in flash memory are no longer pushing consumer SSDs into new product segments. Instead, cheaper flash is driving an increase in SSD capacity.", "That growth in drive capacity has not been steady. For both technical and marketing reasons, consumer SSD capacities stick close to powers of two. The first 2TB consumer SSDs started to show up in 2015, and now 2TB options are common across all the SSD market segments. 4TB drives started to show up in 2018 but are still quite rare, and this year we've seen the first 8TB consumer SSDs.", "Today we're looking at the first two consumer-oriented 8TB SSDs. The 8TB Samsung 870 QVO is a SATA drive from the brand that has been at the forefront of the past several capacity increases and leads the SSD market by most other measures. The other drive is the 8TB Sabrent Rocket Q, a M.2 NVMe drive from a brand that's working to stand out from the crowd of many other Phison partners. Unsurprisingly, both of these drives use four bit per cell QLC NAND flash memory which offers the lowest cost per GB and the highest per-die capacities currently available. QLC NAND generally puts SSDs into an entry-level market segment, but due to their extreme capacities these 8TB SSDs are still some of the most expensive drives in the consumer SSD market.", "The Sabrent Rocket Q is a bit unusual among QLC NVMe SSDs, and not just because it offers such high capacities. Most consumer QLC SSDs use fairly low-end SSD controllers rather than let the performance potential of a high-end controller be wasted on slow QLC NAND. But the Rocket Q uses the Phison E12, a familiar mainstay of the high-end NVMe market segment (but seen here in the more compact E12S packaging). This means the Rocket Q has an 8-channel controller at its disposal rather than just four channels, and that helps immensely at the higher capacities where there's enough flash to compensate for the low performance of QLC NAND.", "The Rocket Q does cut corners a bit by using just one fourth of the DRAM we usually see on mainstream SSDs. That hurts a bit at the lower capacities (though nowhere near as much as a fully DRAMless design would), but is much less of a problem for this 8TB model: 2GB of DRAM is still plenty for the SSD to handle any typical consumer workload.", "The Rocket Q lineup goes from 500GB to 8TB, but we generally consider QLC drives smaller than 1TB to be a poor alternative to DRAMless TLC drives. That's even more true for the Rocket Q, because the 500GB model can only use half of the Phison E12's 8 channels.", "Sabrent has also introduced the Rocket Q4 as a partial successor. This uses the Phison E16 controller and brings PCIe 4 support and improved performance. However, the E16 is not yet (and may never be) available in a small package size like the E12S controller, so it is not yet practical for Sabrent and Phison to squeeze 8TB of QLC onto a PCIe gen4 M.2 drive.", ", but the 8TB capacity arrived a bit later. Other than the higher capacity, there's not much new to say about the 8TB model of their second-generation QLC SSD. It has twice the NAND and twice the DRAM and twice the total write endurance, but the same performance ratings and SLC cache sizes as the 2TB and 4TB models. Samsung's SATA SSD controller doesn't offer much potential for higher performance once all channels are populated with at least two NAND dies.", "Compared to the Rocket Q, the Samsung 870 QVO has higher write endurance ratings both in terms of drive writes per day and total TB written. However, the Rocket Q comes with a 5 year warranty and the 870 QVO only has a 3 year warranty. The Samsung 870 QVO is far cheaper at these high capacities; NVMe SSD controllers are only a little bit more expensive than SATA SSD controllers, but lack of competition leaves Sabrent free to charge a much higher price per GB for their QLC NVMe product. Samsung's vertical integration probably helps them maintain decent profit margins even on their more competitively-priced drive.", "The introduction of QLC NAND as a cheaper alternative to three bit per cell TLC NAND has not revolutionized consumer SSD affordability, but it has made higher SSD capacities practical. QLC NAND offers just a 33% increase in theoretical storage density, but in practice most QLC NAND is manufactured as 1024Gbit dies while TLC NAND is manufactured as 256Gbit and 512Gbit dies. This means that it is easier to fit much more flash into the same form factor using QLC than with TLC NAND. Indeed, the Sabrent Rocket Q is bumping up against the practical limits for a M.2 drive.", "For drives with more commonplace capacities, QLC NAND has several distinct disadvantages. Storing more bits per physical memory cell requires more precise control over the voltage of each cell, and as a result writing to QLC NAND is much slower than writing to TLC NAND (reading is also a bit slower). That sensitivity to cell voltage also reduces the usable write endurance of QLC NAND before data retention becomes a problem. Drives using QLC NAND have to be rated for fewer drive writes per day (DWPD) in order to meet industry standards for data retention of a worn-out consumer SSD.", "However, almost all of those downsides of QLC NAND can be mitigated with sheer capacity. The sequential transfer speed of a single die of NAND flash memory has never been particularly impressive, regardless of how many bits are stored per cell. These 8TB QLC drives use a total of 64 NAND flash dies each, which allows for a lot of parallelism in data transfers (though the SSD's controller becomes a bottleneck). SLC caching helps address most of the remaining performance problems, but when the SLC cache on a QLC drive runs out, the performance impact is much more severe than for TLC drives.", "Write endurance ratings of 0.1 to 0.3 DWPD appear inferior to the 0.5 DWPD or more from good consumer TLC drives, but looking at endurance as a fraction of drive capacity perhaps isn't the most useful measure for these drives. Both of these 8TB QLC drives are warrantied for over 1TB of writes per day (over 2TB per day for the Samsung drive, but its warranty is only three years rather than five). Most consumer use cases for a multi-TB drive do not involve re-writing most of that data often. Large collections of games, movies and photos can use up the ", " of these 8TB drives, but such infrequently-modified data won't put much of a dent in the drive's total write endurance. A mere 3% of the capacity of these drives (240GB) is plenty to hold an OS and most data that will see frequent modification. Filling the rest of the drive with relatively static data won't hurt the drive's lifespan.", "A capacity of 8TB is a bit on the large side even for mechanical hard drives. Sure, consumer-oriented hard drive product lines are starting to go beyond 14TB, but average capacity sold is much lower. Many use cases for large drives don't require high performance. An 8TB SSD will offer significant noise and power efficiency advantages over an 8TB hard drive, but either one is adequate for storing a large movie collection. A mechanical hard drive is definitely preferable for long-term archival/backup duty, but an SSD has advantages for keeping data readily accessible.", "That's especially true in a mobile setting, which may be where these 8TB drives make the most sense. Most desktops can accommodate several drives of lower capacity, and so far these 8TB drives carry a significant price premium on a $/GB basis compared to 1TB or 2TB models. But in a notebook, it's uncommon to have more than one drive bay/slot, and more than three is only found in machines that stretch the definitions of notebook and portable. So the most sensible or plausible use cases we can imagine for these drives are scenarios that more or less fall into mobile workstation territory. But the sustained write speed of these drives will be a problem when it comes to ingesting uncompressed video even if performance is adequate for editing a large amount of video already residing on one of the drives, so these drives definitely aren't suitable for every scenario where multiple TBs of data are thrown around.", "It's also easy to imagine other niche use cases for these drives where cost is of no object: a small form factor nearly-silent NAS, for example. (QLC performance doesn't matter if it sits behind a 1Gbps network bottleneck, and still isn't much of an issue even with a 10Gbps network.) But for today, we're going to evaluate these drives with our usual consumer SSD testing methodology.", "It's tricky deciding what to compare these 8TB drives against. The use of QLC NAND would traditionally flag these drives as low-end options. But their extreme capacity is unmatched by consumer TLC drives, and the raw cost of 8TB of NAND makes for a high-priced drive overall. Aside from QLC drives, most other low-end consumer SSDs are DRAMless TLC designs—and those product lines mostly top out at 1TB. We've included the Mushkin Helix and Toshiba BG4 as representatives of the DRAMless TLC NVMe market segment.", "The largest consumer SSDs we have to compare against are Samsung's earlier 4TB SATA SSDs. We've included the 4TB 860 EVO. For some tests, we also have included results from a few enterprise drives: 8TB NVMe models from Intel and SK hynix, and 4TB SATA drives from Kingston and Samsung. These all use TLC NAND, but without SLC caching.", "High-end consumer SSD product lines are starting to include more multi-TB capacities, but for now the largest high-end consumer NVMe drives we have on hand are a mere 2TB each: Samsung's 970 EVO Plus and the HP EX950."]},

(SK hynix refers to the combination of this die layout and their charge trap flash cells as 4D NAND.) Changes with this generation include a 35% increase in bit productivity (only slightly less than theoretically possible with the jump from 128 to 176 layers) and a 20% increase in cell read speed. The maximum IO speed between NAND dies and the SSD controller has been increased from 1.2GT/s for their 128L NAND to 1.6GT/s for the 176L NAND.", "SK hynix has started sampling a 512Gbit TLC part to SSD controller companies for developing compatible firmware. SK hynix plans to initially use their 176L NAND for mobile products (ie. UFS modules) which will offer 70% faster read speeds and 35% faster write speeds, due to be introduced around the middle of next year.

SK hynix also plans to introduce 1Tbit dies based on their 176L process.", "Based on this announcement, it appears that SK hynix will be fairly competitive during the upcoming generation of 3D NAND. They may be running a bit behind Micron's schedule, but Micron has been pursuing an unusually quick transition to 176L after using their 128L generation as a low-volume test vehicle to work out any issues resulting from their switch from floating gate to charge trap cell design. Meanwhile, Intel's 144L NAND should be arriving early next year, and Kioxia/Western Digital 112L NAND is due to show up any day now. Samsung's 128L NAND started shipping a few months ago in the 980 PRO. While they have not officially announced specs for their next generation, it is expected to go into production next spring with a layer count in the neighborhood of 176L, and to be Samsung's first generation to use string stacking—a technique their competitors all had to adopt while layer counts were in the 64-96L range.", "Related Reading:"]},

This is a QLC NVMe SSD using the Phison E12 controller, which puts it a step up from earlier QLC SSDs that used four-channel Silicon Motion controllers. Unlike last week's review of 8TB SSDs, this time we're dealing with a much more affordable capacity of 1TB. At 8TB, many of the downsides of QLC NAND can be overcome by the sheer volume of flash memory, but this 1TB drive falls toward the low end of the QLC SSD capacity range and faces real competition from entry-level drives using TLC NAND.", "The MP400 is Corsair's answer to Sabrent's Rocket Q and other similar SSDs that have adopted the combination of the Phison E12S controller and QLC NAND. Compared to the Sabrent Rocket Q, Corsair's specifications for the MP400 are a bit more optimistic on performance and a bit lower on the write endurance rating, but we expect the real-world differences between these drives at the same capacity to be insignificant given the near-identical hardware.", "Corsair MP400 1TB (QLC) and the Corsair Force MP510 (TLC)", "Sabrent's Rocket Q product line covers capacities from 500GB to 8TB. Corsair drops the 500GB option, which is very reasonable: we consider 1TB to be the bare minimum for a QLC drive to make sense. That's especially true of these drives that use an 8-channel Phison E12S controller, half of which goes unused on a 500GB QLC model. Mushkin's recently announced ALPHA series goes even further and will only offer 4TB and 8TB options.", "The 1TB capacity point is currently the volume spot in the consumer SSD market for QLC, with the most competition and the best prices on a per-GB basis. QLC SSDs have made multi-TB SSDs more affordable, but 2TB and larger drives still tend to carry a premium. In the entry-level NVMe market segment, there's overlap at 1TB between DRAMless TLC designs and QLC with DRAM designs, two markedly different strategies for cutting costs. There are thankfully only a handful of DRAMless QLC NVMe drives that combine both weaknesses. There are also a few relatively budget-oriented TLC SSDs with DRAM that hit low price points using cheaper 4-channel controllers.", "", "Each of these approaches to an entry-level NVMe SSD (QLC+DRAM vs TLC without DRAM) comes with its own typical weaknesses, and some advantages. DRAMless SSDs will suffer under workloads with heavy random IO, but where they do offer decent performance they tend to have very good power efficiency - not having to power any external DRAM chips helps. QLC SSDs suffer most during sustained writes, and are very heavily reliant on their SLC caches. Smaller drives have smaller SLC caches, so it will be much easier to overflow that write cache on this 1TB MP400 than on the larger variants. Most QLC and TLC drives tend to use SLC caches, but QLC drives also tend to use the largest SLC cache sizes possible, which exacerbates the performance problems once the cache is full - there's little or no empty flash left that could be written to directly as QLC, and until the drive can catch a break, further writes will require compacting data from the SLC cache into QLC blocks to free up space.", "Most drives using 4-channel controllers have notably limited throughput. SK hynix was first to market with a 4-channel drive that could saturate PCIe 3 x4 (with TLC NAND), and that Gold P31 is priced more like a high-end drive. Silicon Motion has introduced a 4-channel Gen4 controller that is also more than fast enough for a Gen3 x4 interface, but it also is not yet cheap enough for entry-level drives. So for now, the 8-channel Phison E12 controller is the best option for high-capacity QLC SSDs to improve performance.", "This review has two main points of comparison for our 1TB Corsair MP400 sample: the 8TB Sabrent Rocket Q we recently reviewed is the most similar, and lets us see how this Phison E12+QLC design scales down to smaller capacities.

Intel has now disclosed that the next generation on the roadmap is codenamed Crow Pass, which will likely be branded as the 300 series. The Crow Pass modules will be launched for use with Intel's Sapphire Rapids Xeon processors. Those are expected to use DDR5 memory, so Crow Pass will be a major update to the interface for Optane Persistent Memory.

The COVID-19 pandemic upended those predictions. Early on in the pandemic, it was anybody's guess whether supply or demand would be more strongly affected. By the middle of the year, it was clear that the fabs in Asia where most of the world's NAND flash is manufactured were able to weather the pandemic with no significant drop in manufacturing capacity.", "The lifestyle shifts to work-from-home and online learning drove some demand for new PCs and increased server capacity for online services, but the broader economic impact of the pandemic largely outweighed those effects and hurt overall demand. The net effect is that, contrary to pre-pandemic predictions, SSD demand is low enough that the NAND flash market has an oversupply and prices are in decline. This is expected to continue through at least the first quarter of 2021 with a 10-15% drop in NAND flash memory prices. The impact on retail SSD prices will be somewhat dulled by the fact that supplies are tight for SSD controllers and some other components, which may push SSD manufacturers to focus a bit more on high-capacity high-end drives, especially datacenter drives.", "Perhaps the biggest shift in consumer storage this year was the arrival of gaming consoles built from the ground up to take advantage of solid state storage. Consoles generally establish the baseline hardware capabilities that games and game engines are designed to target. For over 15 years, this has meant that AAA games are designed to run off hard drives. Even as SSDs have become prevalent in gaming PCs, it has until recently been unthinkable for a game to list a SSD as part of its minimum system requirements. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have now raised the baseline storage performance from that of a mechanical hard drive to a NVMe SSD, and game developers are actively encouraged to take advantage that extra performance. Furthermore, the consoles include various other hardware features intended to complement the new console SSDs; we gave you t", " and their implications back in June.", "So far, the console transition to NVMe storage has had little impact on the PC market or PC gaming—but the consoles have only been shipping for a short while, and game developers are still learning how to adapt to the new freedoms granted by fast storage. This console storage transition will be having more influence on PCs over the next few years. Microsoft is already working to adapt their new Xbox storage APIs into DirectStorage for Windows, and it won't be long before most AAA games require SSDs. For gaming PCs, including a NVMe SSD will be just as important as including a discrete GPU.", "Read More: ", "The transition to PCIe 4.0 started in the middle of 2019 with the debut of AMD's Ryzen 3000 processors. On the storage side of that transition, SSD controller vendor Phison led the way with their E16 controller. But in 2019 and most of 2020, PCIe 4.0 storage remained a niche market segment, only available on new high-end desktops and with SSDs that offered only marginal performance improvement over the best PCIe 3 drives but carried much higher price tags.", "All of Phison's competitors decided to take their time with the PCIe 4.0 transition; 2020 was supposed to be the year that a new wave of gen4 SSD controllers arrived, fabbed on more advanced processes like TSMC's 12nm FinFET so that the full performance of a PCIe 4 x4 interface could be reached within a reasonable power budget. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to delays here as well, and many new SSDs previewed at CES at the beginning of the year arrived late or are still missing. Samsung and Western Digital delivered their new in-house gen4 NVMe SSD controllers during the second half of the year, and SSDs using Phison's E18 controller hit the market at the end of November, just in time to catch the tail end of the holiday shopping season. Silicon Motion's entry-level gen4 controller also arrived this fall, but their high-end contender is not yet available. Planned gen4 controllers from Marvell are absent (though their NVMe controllers have all but vanished from the consumer SSD market anyways), and Innogrit's high-end NVMe controller only just showed up this week in the ADATA Gammix S70 that is currently sampling and should hit the shelves soon.", "So while the PCIe gen4 transition is going more slowly than planned, it is still happening. PCIe 4.0 support is finally starting to creep into mobile platforms, which will help make it more mainstream.

Samsung launched the 870 QVO with their second-generation QLC NAND, but the current EVO and PRO SATA models are still the 860 generation.", "This year, it is clear that the SATA SSD market isn't just boring, but actually dying. When PC OEMs finally started to drop hard drives even from their low-end machines, they replaced them with NVMe SSDs rather than SATA. There are plenty of options for low-end NVMe SSDs, and they pretty much all outperform SATA SSDs for typical real-world use. The capacity advantage for SATA SSDs is now mostly gone: there are 8TB QLC and 4TB TLC options for both SATA and NVMe, though massive NVMe SSDs do still carry a price premium over SATA SSDs of similar capacity. Some major SSD vendors have already EOL'd their client OEM SATA SSDs. The SATA SSD market is collapsing in the same direction as the hard drive market: the list of use cases where SATA SSDs make sense is shrinking, and looks a lot like the list of use cases where hard drives still make sense. The biggest lingering advantage SATA SSDs have going forward is that a desktop or NAS usually has more SATA ports/bays than M.2 NVMe slots.", "Since mechanical hard drives won't be disappearing in the foreseeable future, SATA SSDs can also stick around for a very long time, but increasingly as niche products rather than reasonable candidates for primary storage in a consumer PC.

This stores four bits of data per physical memory cell, rather than the three bits per cell of more mainstream TLC NAND flash memory. The general situation for consumer QLC SSDs isn't much different today from when they first showed up. Compared to TLC, QLC NAND is a bit cheaper, but sacrifices performance and write endurance. Those tradeoffs can make sense for an entry-level SSD, but it's not the only way to make a good affordable SSD. DRAMless SSDs with TLC NAND are still competitive at capacities up to 1TB, especially when using NVMe rather than SATA.", "We're now two or three generations into the QLC era and QLC is making some inroads to the market, but it definitely isn't taking over—not even for entry-level consumer SSDs. Aside from product refreshes that replaced 64-layer QLC with 92/96L QLC, most of the action has been the introduction of new QLC product lines based around the Phison E12S NVMe controller, and a few using the Phison E16 PCIe 4.0 NVMe controller. These drives have raised the bar a bit for consumer QLC performance since they use 8-channel controllers rather than the 4-channel controllers used by most other low-end NVMe SSDs, and those controllers have also helped enable several 8TB M.2 NVMe products.", "There are some indications that in 2021 we may see significant adoption of QLC by PC OEMs. So far, they have been wary of using QLC SSDs in part because they have to cover them as part of the whole system's warranty. Consumer QLC SSDs are no longer an unproven novelty, and OEMs can now secure multiple sources of QLC client SSDs.

Phison is also planning to introduce a new entry-level DRAMless NVMe SSD controller later this year.", "For portable SSDs, Phison is introducing the U17 and U18 controllers.

This is a follow-up to the E19T controller, which has seen very little use in retail consumer SSDs but has actually been outselling their high-end E16 PCIe 4.0 controller due to strong demand from OEMs (especially from an unnamed customer with a very popular gaming product). With the E21T, Phison is finally moving this product segment from 28nm to 12nm fabrication, which allows for performance and power improvements of about 25% compared to the E19T. The basic architecture hasn't changed much for the E21T: it's still a 4-channel controller managed by a single ARM core plus Phison's proprietary coprocessors.

However, the 4TB limitation will be an issue for the handful of companies that have already started shipping 8TB QLC SSDs. Those 8TB M.2 SSDs currently use the E12 controller and its PCIe 4.0 successors are not available in a reduced-size package like the E12S variant. So 8TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs will probably have to push the limits of NAND packaging by stacking 16 dies per package in order to leave enough PCB space for an E16 or E18 controller plus DRAM.", "For high-end NVMe SSDs, Phison's E18 finally started shipping in late 2020. Phison is pretty proud of this controller, and makes much of the fact that they're the only ones so far hitting at least 7GB/s for both reads and writes. Phison plans for the E18 to be their last flagship PCIe 4.0 controller; they're already looking forward to PCIe 5.0, and the E18 will remain their top of the line controller for probably another two years. This doesn't mean Phison is entirely done with the E18. They're still working on firmware tuning, especially around thermal management and trying to squeeze out a little bit more performance at low queue depths. There will also be continuing firmware updates to support newer generations of 3D NAND flash memory. Current E18 drives are using Micron 96L TLC, but Micron has started production of their 176L NAND. Phison expects to finish qualification with that NAND in March, so a second round of E18 drives should start arriving in April with 10-15% performance improvements.", "Phison's older E13T controller is also still around as a low-cost and low-power solution for entry-level NVMe applications.

WD/SanDisk was late entering the consumer NVMe SSD market and its first product was not high-end by the standards of the time. With the second attempt, they got serious and designed their own NVMe SSD controllers, following the same strategy of vertical integration that has worked so well for market leader Samsung. The in-house controller had none of the bugs or performance problems that have plagued the first-generation controllers from most companies.

Overall, these peak performance specs line up pretty well with the Samsung 980 PRO: Samsung quotes higher random write performance, and WD quotes slightly faster sequential writes.", "To reach this level of performance, Western Digital has introduced the second generation of their in-house NVMe SSD controller design. We don't have details of how this controller differs from their first-generation design, but it's a safe bet that almost every part of the chip was substantially upgraded. Compared to the preceding WD Black SN750, the SN850 also benefits from an upgrade to the NAND flash memory, from 64-layer to 96-layer TLC. Western Digital's client OEM SSD product line had already adopted the 96L TLC with the PC SN730, but their retail consumer Gen 3 drives didn't get a matching refresh.", "Our review sample is the 1TB WD Black SN850, the capacity with the highest performance specifications. Western Digital sells the SN850 as either a standard M.2 SSD, or as an M.2 SSD with a heatsink and RGB lighting; we're testing the cheaper plain version. The stylized heatsink and RGB lighting adds a lot to the price tag, and we found that both the earlier WD Black SN750 and the competing Samsung 980 PRO perform fine without extra cooling, so we expect the SN850 with the heatsink to be solely a cosmetic upgrade.", "The most important competitors for the SN850 are other PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs. We have results for both the Samsung 980 PRO and the Silicon Power US70 based on the older Phison E16 controller.

The 970 PRO was the last high-end consumer drive to use MLC NAND, which gave it a significant advantage on heavy, long-running storage workloads as compared with TLC SSDs that use SLC caching to provide improved peak performance. The 970 PRO is old enough that newer, faster TLC NAND is catching up even in tests where MLC used to be a major advantage—and of course the latest and greatest TLC drives with PCIe 4.0 have far higher peak performance.", "Representing the more mainstream parts of the consumer SSD market, we have several other Western Digital drives: the WD Black SN750 is the SN850's immediate predecessor, and the SN730 is the OEM counterpart with 96L NAND.

The NV1 does reflect the market's shift toward higher capacities, with the product line starting at 500GB and going up to 2TB. We expect retail prices for the NV1 will end up cheaper than the A2000, but for the moment the pricing direct from Kingston is only marginally cheaper.

QLC initially arrived as a low-end alternative that provides better density and price, but the trade-off has been worse performance (and endurance). So far the use of QLC NAND has always meant that any drive with QLC belongs in an entry-level market segment, competing against the cheaper TLC NAND SSDs that cut corners on other components. But as more SSD vendors adopt QLC NAND in a wider range of products, some are starting to challenge the assumption that QLC is only for low-quality bargain products.", "Sabrent and Corsair are two very familiar brands that market SSDs based on reference designs from SSD controller vendor Phison. Both brands have followed Phison's lead in using QLC NAND for M.2 NVMe SSDs. The latest and greatest QLC solution from Phison uses its E16 SSD controller, which was the first consumer SSD controller to support PCIe Gen4. The Sabrent Rocket Q4 and Corsair MP600 CORE we are reviewing today are part of the first generation of PCIe 4 SSDs to use QLC NAND: an almost paradoxical combination of a high-end PCIe 4.0 connectivity with low-end QLC NAND. The question to answer is whether if QLC NAND is moving up market into mainstream or high-end products, or is it just PCIe 4.0 support now trickling down to low-end higher-capacity drives? This is what we set to find out with this review.", "The five-year warranty and pricing around $0.15/GB are also indicative that the MP600 CORE isn't exactly entry-level. But on the other hand, the write endurance rating of just over 0.1 drive writes per day is much lower than the usual 0.3 DWPD expected from mainstream consumer SSDs. There are also some unimpressive performance metrics, especially for the smallest 1TB capacity.", "Sabrent's published specs for their Rocket Q4 are quite a bit less detailed, but follow the same general pattern:", "The Phison E16 controller was originally a very successful bid to be first on the market with a controller supporting PCIe 4.0: Phison ended up having a monopoly on PCIe 4.0 SSDs for over a year, and even some SSD brands that don't routinely use Phison controllers brought out new flagship models based on this controller. But now the successor E18 controller is shipping, as well as competing top of the line PCIe 4.0 drives from both Samsung and Western Digital with their own custom controllers. That leaves the E16 as an outdated part, with performance that is no longer sufficient for a flagship model, and power consumption that is quite high. The E16 is manufactured on 28nm whereas all the other PCIe 4.0 SSD controllers are build on more advanced nodes like 12nm. This means that the E16 is ripe for that cheaper PCIe 4.0 market, which makes sense when adding in some high density QLC.", "All that being said, the E16 controller is still a step up from Phison's very successful E12 PCIe 3.0 SSD controller. These PCIe 4.0 controllers are backwards compatible with PCIe 3.0, so even in a system that only supports PCIe 3.0, a drive based on the Phison E16 (like the ones we are testing today) is a bit faster than the E12.", "It doesn't currently make sense to pair QLC NAND with the expensive flagship E18 controller, but the E16 has found a second life as Phison's more affordable and mature Gen4 controller when paired with QLC. One consequence of replacing E12+QLC drives with E16+QLC designs is that the E16 controller is physically larger than the compact E12S version's package, and that size difference means the 8TB models cannot yet move up to the E16 controller due to lack of space on a M.2 2280 PCB. That's a shame, because the best showings for QLC NVMe SSDs have been at the largest capacities where huge SLC caches and the highest possible degree of parallelism allow drives to mostly overcome the worst downsides of QLC NAND.", "In this review, we're comparing the 4TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 and 2TB Corsair MP600 CORE against a variety of other SSDs, from low-end QLC SATA SSDs to high-end gen4 drives with TLC NAND.

Two waves of high-end SSDs have now hit the market, and last year we saw several brands introduce QLC-based SSDs using the now-outdated first-wave Gen4 SSD controller from Phison. More recently, PCIe 4.0 support has arrived for the mainstream mid-range market segment thanks to the ADATA XPG Gammix S50 Lite, based on the Silicon Motion SM2267 controller and TLC NAND flash memory.", "The ADATA S50 Lite uses Silicon Motion's first PCie 4.0 SSD controller: the SM2267. Opting to start small, Silicon Motion has launched their mainstream SSD controller first, while their ", " will eventually be filling the high-end role.", "To that end, the SM2267 serves Silicon Motion's lineup as a smaller, cheaper design aimed at mainstream consumer use cases. To accomplish this, Silicon Motion has built the SM2267 on a tried-and-true (and cheap) 28nm process and equipped the controller with 4 NAND channels, as opposed to the 12nm (or smaller) 8-channel controllers that are used in the latest high-end drives. This does limit maximum performance, but it also helps to keep costs in check, something that's especially useful during the current chip crunch.", "Intel's recently-launched third generation QLC SSD (the ", ") uses a close relative of this controller; the SM2265 is an Intel-commissioned derivative of the SM2267 that lacks PCIe 4.0 support, but is otherwise identical in all the important ways. As we'll see from the S50 Lite's performance, the Intel 670p isn't missing out on much without that Gen4 support.", "As for the subject of today's review, the ADATA XPG Gammix S50 Lite and its SM2267 controller is part of a growing trend of mainstream NVMe SSDs moving to 4-channel controllers rather than 8 channels. The capacity of individual NAND flash memory dies has grown to the point that an 8-channel controller is not necessary to get 2TB of flash connected, and the IO speed of recent generations of NAND flash is fast enough that a newer four-channel controller can match the performance of older 8-channel designs. This was first demonstrated to great effect by the ", ". On paper, the Gammix S50 Lite promises more or less the same thing: performance that matches or slightly exceeds what we see from high-end PCIe Gen3 SSDs also using TLC NAND, despite working with half as many NAND channels.", "ADATA equips the S50 Lite with a fairly thick heatspreader, and like most of their Gammix SSDs, that heatspreader comes already attached to the drive rather than packaged separately as with their SX series drives. Instead of using their typical thermal paste, this heatspreader is attached with what is by far the most tenacious thermal tape we've ever encountered. It is reinforced with a tight-woven stiff fabric and the adhesive was strong enough that removing the heatspreader without permanently damaging the drive required copious use of solvents instead of just a bit of gentle prying.", "So while we had originally speculated that the SM2267 controller might allow the S50 Lite to be the first Gen4 SSD suitable for laptop usage (hoping for similar power efficiency to the SK hynix Gold P31), this heatspreader plus the double-sided design means the S50 Lite will be a challenge to fit into some notebooks.", "The SM2267 controller actually has a slightly higher pin count than the older 8-channel SM2262(EN) controllers, but the SM2267 uses denser packaging to fit in the same footprint as their earlier 4-channel SM2263 controller. The resulting PCB layout is not at all crowded, and could have easily been made into a single-sided design like the Intel 670p, had ADATA wanted to stack 16 NAND dies per package. Any future drives that use the DRAMless SM2267XT variant certainly should be single-sided.", "Our 2TB S50 Lite sample is equipped with 1GB of DDR4 DRAM—half as much as we would typically expect from a mainstream or high-end SSD. As the high-end has moved on to PCIe Gen4, we have seen an increasing number of mid-range or low-end NVMe SSDs cut back from the usual 1GB per 1TB ratio of DRAM to NAND, and with the S50 Lite that trend has crossed over to Gen4. Having half or a fourth of the usual DRAM is nowhere near as serious a handicap as an entirely DRAMless SSD design, and will generally only make a difference for very storage-intense usage with heavy multitasking—workloads that are a bit beyond the intended use case for a drive like the S50 Lite.", "Also noteworthy about the S50 Lite is that ADATA announced and published specs for a 512GB model, but we've only seen the 1TB and 2TB models hit the market.", "ADATA's original Gammix S50 was a Phison E16 drive: their first flagship Gen4 drive and part of the first wave of consumer Gen4 SSDs.

There are now several competing PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs and controllers that handily outperform the Phison E16, but Phison has stayed competitive by bringing out a second-generation PCIe 4.0 controller, the E18. Today we're looking at one of many drives built around that controller: the Inland Performance Plus 2TB.", "The Inland brand is owned by the parent company of American retailer Micro Center. Most or all Inland-branded SSDs are simply Phison reference designs with little or no customization beyond cosmetics. Inland SSDs are frequently great value options—especially for Micro Center's in-store only deals, but even their online prices tend to be very competitive. Part of the discount comes from their tendency toward shorter warranty periods: the Inland Performance Plus has only a three year warranty despite being a high-end flagship model. Fortunately, the total write endurance rating is the same as competing drives that carry five year warranties, and the SSD hardware itself is identical to other brands selling the same SSD reference design under different heatsinks and labels.", "As part of the second wave of PCIe 4.0 SSD controllers, the Phison E18 aims to use substantially all of the performance available from the PCIe 4.0 x4 interface: sequential transfers up to around 7.4 GB/s and random IO up to about 1M IOPS. Hitting that level of performance while staying within M.2 power delivery and thermal dissipation limits required migrating to 12nm FinFET fabrication from the cheaper 28nm widely used by PCIe 3.0 SSD controllers and by the Phison E16. But even so, the Phison E18 can draw more power than the E16 controller because the increase in performance is so large. Competition for the Phison E18 includes in-house controllers used in the latest flagship consumer SSDs from Samsung and Western Digital, newcomer Innogrit's IG5236 Rainier controller, and Silicon Motion's upcoming SM2264 controller.", "The Inland Performance Plus does not quite hit the theoretical limits of the Phison E18 controller. The 1TB model is clearly handicapped on some performance metrics compared to the 2TB model, but even the latter is only rated for 7GB/s sequential reads and 650-700k IOPS instead of 7.4GB/s and 1M IOPS. This mostly comes down to the Inland Performance Plus and other current E18 drives using 96L TLC NAND with 1200MT/s IO between the NAND and the controller, while the E18 can support up to 1600MT/s IO. A new round of E18-based products will start hitting the market soon using Micron 176L TLC that operates with the higher IO speed and should bring some other performance and efficiency improvements. We expect some of these new drives to be announced at Computex next month.", "Like most drives using the Phison E18 controller, the Inland Performance Plus comes with a fairly substantial heatsink installed. The controller package is small enough to share space with a DRAM package and four NAND packages on the front of the PCB, which means there's a lot of heat concentrated in a small area. (The Inland Performance Plus also has DRAM and NAND on the back of the PCB.) PCIe 4.0 has barely started showing up in laptops and using the full performance of a drive like the Inland Performance Plus requires more power than most laptops are able to sink away from their M.2 slots, so it's reasonable to regard this drive as pretty much desktop-only.", " ", "The most important competitors for the Inland Performance Plus are other Phison E18 drives and the current flagship PCIe 4.0 drives from Samsung and Western Digital.

For smaller capacities, we recommend avoiding QLC and going with a DRAMless TLC drive if necessary.

Updating from 64L to 96L TLC is usually nothing to complain about, but some of the controller changes really should have been introduced with new models. Switching from 256Gbit to 512Gbit TLC dies can also lower performance, especially for the lower-capacity drives. Many of the cheaper drives based around the Phison E12 controller have switched to the more compact E12S variant and reduced the amount of DRAM, which hurts performance a bit on the heaviest workloads. Some drives based on the Silicon Motion SM2262(EN) controllers have also seen tweaks that may hurt performance a bit. A few brands have even taken the more drastic step of switching between SMI and Phison controllers without renaming the product—we've seen kind of behavior before in cheaper market segments, but it's a new low for this market segment.", "Ultimately, despite such unannounced hardware changes, these drives are still suitable for inclusion in this category. The performance changes are minor and seldom noticeable in real-world usage. What we're seeing is really a result of the competition for the performance crown moving into the PCIe 4.0 space. SSD makers are much less focused on performance for their PCIe 3.0 products now and are making very reasonable compromises to deliver more affordable products. The only problem here is the lack of transparency.", "The PNY XLR8 CS3030 isn't quite the cheapest Phison E12 drive, but at the lower capacities it's only $1 more than the drives that come with shorter three year warranties rather than the standard five years. For larger capacities, the best prices are currently on the Mushkin Pilot-E and HP EX950, both drives based on the SM2262EN controller that provides great peak performance. The SK hynix Gold P31 has occasionally been on sale, but is mostly sticking to its original launch pricing that is a bit above average for this market segment. For consumers concerned with maximizing battery life without sacrificing performance, it may be worth paying that small premium.", "Most of the major players have delivered their high-end PCIe 4.0 competitors. Silicon Motion's SM2264 controller is still MIA, and the various Phison E18 drives will soon be getting refreshed with 176L TLC. In the meantime, the WD Black SN850 seems to be the overall performance king by most measures, though real-world differences are very minor. ADATA's XPG Gammix S70 featuring the Innogrit Rainier controller is a bit slower than most of the other current flagships, but it's also discounted by a bit, especially for its 2TB model. At capacities below 1TB, none of these controllers have enough flash to reach full speed, so an older and cheaper Phison E16 based drive like the Sabrent Rocket 4.0 may make more sense—but those E16 drives are getting a bit harder to find in stock.", " ", "The SATA SSD market is unsurprisingly pretty stagnant. It's becoming increasingly common for manufacturers to silently update the NAND in SATA SSDs without changing the product name, which is why products like the Crucial MX500 are still around with no successor on the horizon.

All of these high-capacity models carry a price-per-GB premium over the more mainstream capacities from the same product lines, and the best performance is usually found on the 1TB or 2TB models. So these models bring significant tradeoffs, and aren't necessarily the best way to equip a system with an excess of solid-state storage. But for notebooks with only one M.2 slot or other scenarios where the highest per-drive capacities are required, these multi-TB drives offer new possibilities and much lower prices than high-capacity enterprise SSDs.", "The hard drive market has generally cleared the way for compatibility with such massive drives. However, as far as we know none of these SSDs have switched to using 4kB sectors by default rather than 512-byte sectors. This means that cloning from a smaller SSD onto a 4TB or 8TB SSD and then expanding the filesystem is generally a straightforward process, but cloning from a 4k-native hard drive onto one of these SSDs may not be an option.", "SATA drives still offer much better pricing at these large capacities: the Samsung 870 QVO is by far the cheapest 8TB option, and the WD Blue with TLC is cheaper than NVMe drives with QLC. For users willing to pay for NVMe performance, even a QLC drive will be pretty fast with 2TB or more to work with, so the Inland Platinum and Mushkin ALPHA are good choices. The PNY XLR8 CS3030 is currently one of the most affordable TLC drives with high-capacity options."]},
{"title": "Caching And Tiering: Intel Optane Memory H20 and Enmotus FuzeDrive SSD Reviewed", "paragraph": ["The latest iteration of Intel's Optane Memory SSD caching is here. The new Optane Memory H20 is two NVMe drives in one, combining a 1TB QLC drive (derived from their recent 670p) with an updated 32GB Optane cache drive, all on one M.2 card. We're also taking a look at the Enmotus FuzeDrive SSD, a different take on the two-drives-in-one idea that augments its QLC with a dedicated pool of fast SLC NAND flash. Each of these drives is paired with software to intelligently manage data placement, putting heavily-used data on the faster, higher-endurance storage media. The overall goal of the two products is the same: to combine the affordable capacity of QLC NAND with the high-end performance and write endurance of SLC NAND or 3D XPoint memory.", "There is a long history behind the general idea of combining fast and slow storage devices into one pool of storage that doesn't require end users to manually manage data placement. Caching of data in RAM is ubiquitous with CPUs having multiple levels of cache, and hard drives and some SSDs also having their own RAM caches, but all of those are temporary by nature. ", " caches using a faster form of non-volatile storage has never been quite as pervasive, but there have been plenty of examples over the years.", "In the consumer space, caching was of great interest when SSDs first started to go mainstream: they were far faster than hard drives, but not yet large enough to be used as a complete replacement for hard drives. Intel implemented ", " (SRT) into their Rapid Storage Technology (RST) drivers starting a decade ago with the Z68 chipset for Sandy Bridge. Hard drive manufacturers also introduced hybrid drives, but with such pitifully small NAND flash caches that they weren't of much use.", "More recently, the migration of SSDs to store more bits of data per physical memory cell has led to consumer SSDs implementing their own transparent caching. All consumer SSDs using TLC or QLC NAND manage a cache layer that operates a portion of the storage as SLC (or occasionally MLC)—less dense, but faster.", "Intel made another big push for SSD caching with their ", ": tiny M.2 drives equipped with the promising new 3D XPoint memory, and rather confusingly branded Optane Memory as if they were DRAM alternatives instead of NVMe SSDs. Intel initially pitched these as cache devices for use in front of hard drives. The implementation of Optane Memory built on their RST work, but came with new platform requirements: motherboard firmware had to be able to understand the caching system in order to properly load an operating system from a cached volume, and that firmware support was only provided on Kaby Lake and newer platforms. The Optane + hard drive strategy never saw huge success; the continuing transition to TLC NAND meant SSDs that were big enough and fast enough became widely affordable. Multiple-drive caching setups were also a poor fit for the size and power constraints of notebooks. Optane caching in front of TLC NAND was possible, but not really worth the cost and complexity, especially with SLC caching working pretty well for mainstream single-drive setups.", "QLC NAND provided a new opportunity for Optane caching, leading to the ", " and the new Optane Memory H20 we're reviewing today. These squeeze Intel's consumer QLC drives (", " and ", " respectively) and one of their Optane Memory cache drives onto a single M.2 card. This requires a somewhat non-standard interface; most systems cannot detect both devices and will be able to access either the QLC or the Optane side of the drive, but not both. Some Intel consumer platforms starting with Coffee Lake have the capability to detect these drives and configure the PCIe x4 link to a M.2 slot as two separate x2 links.", "The caching system for Optane Memory H20 works pretty much the same as when using separate Optane and slow drives, though Intel has continued to refine their heuristics for data placement with successive releases of their RST drivers. One notable downside is that splitting the M.2 slot's four PCIe lanes into two x2 links means there's a bottleneck on the QLC side; the Silicon Motion SSD controllers Intel uses support four lanes, but only two can be wired up on the H10 and H20. For the H10, this hardly mattered because the QLC portion of that drive (equivalent to the Intel SSD 660p) could only rarely provide more than 2GB/s, so limiting it to PCIe 3.0 x2 had only a minor impact. Intel's 670p is quite a bit faster thanks to more advanced QLC and a much-improved controller, so limiting it to PCIe 3.0 x2 on the Optane Memory H20 actually hurts.", "Both the Optane Memory H10 and H20 are rated for peak throughput in excess of what either the Optane or QLC portion can provide on its own. To achieve this, Intel's caching software has to be capable of doing some RAID0-like striping of data between the two sub-devices; it can't simply send requests to the Optane portion while falling back on the QLC only when strictly necessary.", "At first glance, the Optane Memory H20 looks like a rehash of the H10, but it is a substantially upgraded product. The Optane portion of the H20 is a bit faster than previous Optane Memory products including the Optane portion of the H10. Intel didn't give specifics on how they improved performance here, but they are still using first-generation 3D XPoint memory rather than the second-generation 3DXP that is now shipping in the enterprise Optane P5800X SSD.", "The QLC side of the drive gets a major upgrade from 64L to 144L QLC NAND and a controller upgrade from the Silicon Motion SM2263 to the SM2265. The new controller is an Intel-specific custom part for the 670p and the H20, derived from the ", " but lacking the PCIe 4.0 capability. Cutting out the PCIe 4.0 support was reasonable for the Intel 670p because the QLC isn't fast enough to go beyond PCIe 3.0 speeds anyways, and Intel can reduce power draw and maybe save a bit of money with the SM2265 instead of the SM2267. But for the Optane Memory H20 and its PCIe x2 limitation for the QLC portion, it would have been nice to be able to run those two lanes at Gen4 speed.", "The Optane Memory H10 was initially planned for both OEM and retail sales, but the retail version was cancelled before release and the (somewhat spotty) support for H10 that was provided by retail Coffee Lake motherboards ended up being useless to consumers. The H20 is launching as an OEM-only product from the outset, which ensures it will only be used in compatible Intel-based systems. This allows Intel to largely avoid any issues with end-users needing to install and configure the caching software, because OEMs will take care of that. The Optane Memory H20 is planned to start shipping in new systems starting in June."]},

To reach this level of performance while staying within the power and thermal limits of common enterprise SSD form factors, Marvell has had to improve power efficiency by 40% over their previous generation SSD controllers. That goes beyond the improvement that can be gained simply from smaller fab process nodes, so Marvell has had to significantly alter the architecture of their controllers. The Bravera SC5 controllers still include a mix of Arm cores (Cortex-R8, Cortex-M7 and a Cortex-M3), but now includes much more fixed-function hardware to handle the basic tasks of the controller with high throughput and consistently low latency.", "Such an architectural shift often means sacrificing flexibility, but Marvell doesn't expect that to be a problem thanks in large part to the Open Compute Project's Cloud SSD specifications.

The Cloud SSD specs were initially a collaboration between Microsoft and Facebook but have caught on in the broader market and even have the support of traditional enterprise server vendors like Dell and HP. This allows controller vendors like Marvell and SSD manufacturers to more narrowly focus their product development efforts, and to target a wider range of customers with a single hardware and firmware platform.

The latest in the company’s lineup of postage stamp-sized SSDs, the BG5 series sees Kioxia reworking both the NAND and the underlying controller to use newer technologies. As a result, the latest iteration of the drive is gaining overall higher performance thanks to the combination of PCIe 4.0 support as well as the switch to Kioxia’s latest BiCS5 NAND. However, in an unexpected twist, the BG series is no longer a single-chip design; instead, the NAND and controller on the BG5 are now separate packages.", "Long a fixture of pre-built systems, Kioxia’s BG series of SSDs have been a favorite of OEMs for the last several years due to their small size – typically M2. 2230 or smaller – as well as their low cost. In particular, the DRAMless design of the drive keeps the overall component costs down, and it allowed Kioxia to simply stack the NAND dies on top of the controller, giving the SSDs their small footprint. As well, the simple design and tight thermal tolerances of such a stacked design mean that power consumption has been kept quite low, too. The resulting performance of the drives is very much entry-level, and thus rarely noteworthy, but for a drive not much bigger than a postage stamp, it fills a small role.", "Coming a bit over two years since the ", " was introduced, the headlining update to BG5 is the addition of PCIe 4.0 support. Whereas BG4 was a PCIe 3.0 x4 drive, BG5 is PCIe 4.0 x4, which at this point gives the drive more bus bandwidth than it could ever possibly hope to use. Truth be told, I was a bit surprised to see that the BG5 went PCIe 4.0 given the limited performance impact on an entry-level drive and the tight power limits, though there are some second-order benefits from PCIe 4.0. In particular, any OEM who ends up only allocating two lanes to the drive (something that happens now and then) will still get the equivalent of PCIe 3.0 x4 speeds out of the drive, which in turn is still high enough to run the drive at almost full performance. This underscores one of the big improvements offered by higher PCIe speeds: for components that don’t need more bandwidth, integrators can instead cut down on the number of lanes.", "Speaking of performance, the BG5 drives are rated for higher throughput than their predecessor. Kioxia’s official press release only offers a single set of figures, so these are almost certainly for the 1TB configuration, but for that drive they are rating it at 2900MB/sec writes and 3500MB/sec reads – the latter just crossing the limits of PCIe  3.0 x4. Random writes and reads are rated at 450K IOPS and 500K IOPS respectively. As always, these figures are against writing to the drive’s SLC cache, so sustained write throughput does eventually taper off.", "As this is a DRAMless drive, there is no significant on-package caching/buffer layer to talk about. Instead, like its predecessor, Kioxia is relying on ", " (HMB) tech to improve the performance of their drive. HMB isn’t used to cache user data, but instead is used to cache mapping information about the drive’s contents in order to speed up access. Along with the latest generation of this tech, Kioxia has also updated their controller to support ", "Backing the new PCIe 4.0 controller is Kioxia’s ", ", which is a 112L design. BiCS5 has been shipping for a while now, so it’s very much a known quantity, but the time has finally come for it to trickle down into the BG series of drives. BiCS5 was a relatively modest increase in density over BiCS4, so it’s not too surprising here that Kioxia is keeping the largest BG5 configuration at 1TB, which would mean stacking 8 of the 1Tbit dies.", "But perhaps the biggest change with the BG5 isn’t the specifications of the controller or the NAND on their own, but rather the fact that the two parts are alone to begin with. A staple of the BG5 series design has been the small package enabled by stacking the memory and controller together into a single package. But from Kioxia’s supplied product photo, we can clearly see that the NAND and the controller are separate packages. Kioxia made no mention of this change, so we can only speculate about whether it’s for simplicity in construction (no TSVs to the controller) or maybe the heat put off by a PCIe 4.0 controller. But one way or another, it’s a big change in how the small drive is assembled.", "As a result of this change, the BGA M.2 1620 form factor – which supplied the single-chip package in a solder-down package – has gone away. Instead, the smallest form factor is now the removable M.2 2230 version. The postage stamp-sized M.2 2230 form factor has long been the staple of the lineup, as it’s what we’ve seen in Microsoft’s Surface products and other thin and light designs over the years. Since the form factor here isn’t changing, the use of multiple packages shouldn’t alter things much for a lot of OEMs. And for OEMs that need physically larger drives for compatibility reasons, Kioxia is also formally offering a 2280 design as well. A simple two-chip solution on such a large PCB is unremarkable, but it would allow the BG5 to be easily inserted into systems that are designed to take (and typically use) 2280 drives.", ": On the subject of BG5 becoming a two chip solution, Kioxia got back to us with a bit more background information on the change. The change is in part due to gradually increasing power requirements running headlong into the thermal limits of the single chip design. Moving the controller out allows both it and the NAND to be directly cooled, which ultimately allows for better performance at the cost of higher power consumption. More surprising, Kioxia also noted that BGA solutions are falling out of favor with OEMs, whom are swinging back to replaceable/serviceable modules. As a result, Kioxia didn't see a need for a single-chip BGA design for the BG5.", "As these are OEM drives, no pricing information is available. The drives are currently sampling to Kioxia’s customers, so expect to see them land in commercial products in 2022."]},

Among these are Samsung, who is announcing their first PCIe 5.0 SSD for servers, the PM1743. Based around a new, unnamed PCIe controller, Samsung’s latest server SSD is pairing that with the company’s current (sixth) generation V-NAND. Based on their published specifications, Samsung is touting upwards of 70-90% better performance over their previous-generation drive based on the workload. And tying in with CES in a couple of weeks, the new drive has already been awarded a CES 2022 Innovation Award.", "At a high level, the PM1743 is the successor to Samsung’s current PM1733 enterprise SSD. Whereas the existing drive is based around a PCIe 4.0 controller and Samsung’s 96L fifth-generation V-NAND, the PM1743 bumps this up to PCIe 5.0 and 128L sixth-generation V-NAND instead. Given the general nature of today’s announcement, the company isn’t offering detailed technical specifications on the drive’s architecture, but between the NAND and controller improvements, they would seem to largely be able to keep up with the additional bandwidth afforded by the move to PCIe 5.0.", "On paper, the PCie 5.0 x4 link the drive uses can reach bandwidth rates as high as 15.76GB/sec. For the PM1743, in turn, Samsung is claiming peak sequential read rates of 13GB/second, and peak sequential write rates of 6.6GB/sec (presumably to the drive’s SLC cache). This adds up to 86% higher peak read speeds and 89% higher peak write speeds than the PM1733. Or to put that in terms of IOPS, Samsung is claiming that the new drive will be able to hit 2.5M IOPS on random reads, and 250K IOPS on random writes.", "The updated Samsung controller is also embedding its own security processor and root of trust. Samsung’s announcement is light on the details, but at a high level, the company is doubling down on security by giving the drive a degree of security control independent of the host server.", "The company is also touting these updates as having improved the energy efficiency of the PM1743 by 30% over the PM1733, bringing it to 608MB/sec/watt. Given that data transfer rates have improved by upwards of 90% while power efficiency has only improved by 30%, it looks like the PM1743 will have a higher active power utilization rate than its predecessor. Doing some napkin math against the PM1733, which has a published figure of 20W, would put the active power of the PM1743 at around 30W.", "Meanwhile, Samsung’s press release also confirms that the company has been working with Intel to validate the new drive. Samsung doesn’t go into any further details, but with Alder Lake (12", " gen Core) already shipping now as the first mass market PCIe 5.0-capable platform, Samsung has presumably been testing against that, as well as the forthcoming Sapphire Rapids (next-gen Xeon) platform.", "New for this generation of SSDs, Samsung will be offering the PM1743 in two form factors. The first will be the traditional 2.5-inch U.2 form factor. Meanwhile, joining U.2 will be ", " that is designed to be slightly larger than U.2 drives while incorporating a connector that can handle up to 16 lanes of PCIe.  SSDs of course won’t use that many lanes, but it’s a form factor that both drive and system vendors have been pushing for, making it the front-runner as the eventual successor to U.2.

Today's review takes a look at the performance and value proposition of the Portable SSD T7 Shield. Our detailed analysis in the review below reveals another trick that Samsung has up their sleeve, which makes the T7 Shield a worthy successor (rather than just an addition) to the Portable SSD T7 family.", "External bus-powered storage devices capable of 1GBps+ performance have become entry-level offerings in the market today.

Disassembling the unit is fairly trivial after taking out the four screws hidden under the product label stickers on either side, and removing the elastomer covering. This reveals an aluminum metal enclosure. The plastic tray holding the actual PSSD board can then be slid out after the removal of the plastic piece opposite the connector end. Both plastic end pieces have grommets around their periphery to ensure a good seal and contribute to the IP65 rating. The main board is held on to the plastic tray by four smaller screws. The connector on the main board has a red-colored sealing band to ensure that it doesn't become an ingress point for external material.", "A full teardown gallery is also presented above.

{"title": "Micron’s 232 Layer NAND Now Shipping: 1Tbit, 6-Plane Dies With 50% More I/O Bandwidth", "paragraph": ["Ahead of next week’s Flash Memory Summit, Micron this morning is announcing that their next-generation 232 layer NAND has begun shipping. The sixth generation of Micron’s 3D NAND technology, 232L is slated to offer both improved bandwidth and larger die sizes – most notably, introducing Micron’s first 1Tbit TLC NAND dies, which at this point are the densest in the industry. According to the company, the new NAND is already shipping to customers and in Crucial SSD products in limited volumes, with further volume ramping to take place later in the year.", "Micron first announced their 232L NAND back in May during their Investor Day event, revealing that the NAND would be available this year, and that the company intended to ramp up production by the end of the year. And while that yield ramp is still ongoing, Micron’s Singapore fab is already capable of producing enough of the new NAND that Micron is comfortable in announcing it is shipping, albeit clearly in limited quantities.", "From a technical perspective, Micron’s 232L NAND further builds upon the basic design elements Micron honed in that generation. So we’re once again looking at a string stacked design, with Micron using a pair of 116 layer decks, up from 88 layers in the previous generation. 116 layer decks, in turn, are notable as this is the first time Micron has been able to produce a single deck over 100 layers, a feat previously limited to Samsung. This in turn has allowed Micron to produce cutting-edge NAND with just two decks, something that may not be possible for much longer as companies push toward designs with over 300 total layers.", "Micron’s NAND decks continue to be built with their charge-trap, CMOS under Array (CuA) architecture, which sees the bulk of the NAND’s logic placed under the NAND memory cells. Micron has long cited this as giving them an ongoing advantage in NAND density, and that’s once again on show for their 232L NAND. According to the company they’ve achieved a density of 14.6 Gbit/mm", ", which is about 43% denser than their 176L NAND. And, according to Micron, anywhere between 35% to 100% denser than competing TLC products.", "The improved density has allowed Micron to finally produce their first 1Tbit TLC die, which from a productization standpoint means that Micron can now also produce 2TB chip packages by stacking 16 of their 232L dies. This is good news for SSD capacities, which at the high-end are often limited by the number of packages that can be placed. Though it does mean that there’s a potential loss of performance at lower capacities due to a decrease parallelism from implementing fewer packages.", "At the same time, Micron has also been working on the size of their chip packaging, and as a result while the larger capacity means that their die size has increased on a generational basis (we estimate ~70.1mm", " given Micron’s density figures), they’ve still shrunk their chip packaging by 28%. As a result, a single chip package is down from 12mm x 18mm (216mm", ") to 11.5mm x 13.5mm (~155mm", "). So for Micron’s downstream customers, the combination of the greater capacity and physically smaller packages for Micron’s NAND means that device manufacturers can cut down on the amount of space they allocate to NAND packages, or go the other direction and try to cram in even more packages into a similar amount of space.", "Besides density improvements, the latest generation of Micron’s NAND is also allowing the company to upgrade their hardware to take advantage of newer I/O technologies, as well as to implement their own improvements to increase transfer speeds. The big news here is that Micron has increased the number of planes within their NAND die from 4 to 6, further improving the parallelism available within each die.  Quad (four) plane designs ", ", and as the density of NAND grows, so too are the number of planes in order for transfer rates to keep up with these greater densities. Micron has confirmed that the planes in 232L NAND offer independent reads, though they aren’t being quite as explicit on what kind of wordline dependencies remain for writes.", "This increase in parallelism, along with improved internal transfer rates, has allowed Micron to significantly improve their per-die read and write speeds. According to the company, read speeds have improved by over 75% over their 176L generation NAND, and meanwhile write speeds have outright doubled.", "Coupled with this, Micron has also implemented the latest generation of ONFi on their peripheral logic. Finalized in 2021 and now rolling out in the first NAND products, ONFi increases controller-NAND transfer rates by 50%, bringing it to 2400MT/second. ONFi 5.0 also introduced a new NV-LPDDR4 signaling method, which is available with the same 2400MT/s rate but, as it’s based on LPDDR technology, consumes less power. According to Micron, they’re seeing per-bit energy transfer savings of over 30%, which makes for a significant reduction in energy consumption. Though as always with these sorts of comparisons, it’s worth noting that the bandwidth gains exceed the energy savings (50% vs. 30%), so our expectation is that overall energy consumption is going to go up for high-performance products that run at the fastest speeds supported by Micron’s 232L NAND.", "As for productization, Micron is pitching 232L NAND as a full stack replacement for 176L NAND – meaning that Micron considers it suitable for everything from mobile and IoT to clients and data center products. To that end, the company is already making initial shipments to their customers, including their own Crucial subsidiary. As with past generations of Micron NAND, starting early with Crucial allows the company to get some hands-on experience in developing full-featured products with their new NAND before they roll it into their own enterprise equipment. Interestingly, however, Micron isn’t announcing any new Crucial products right now, which strongly implies that Crucial is going to begin implementing the new NAND in existing products. If that’s the case, then Crucial customers will want to pay attention to what’s going on and what revision of a drive they’re buying, as the larger 1Tb die could have performance implications for products originally designed around 512Gbit dies.", "Wrapping things up, today’s announcement should be the tip of the iceberg for Micron’s 232L shipments. With volume ramping expected to continue through this end of this calendar year, Micron’s plans call for the company to significantly increase the amount of next-generation NAND they’re shipping, going well beyond these initial volumes. Ultimately, this means that products equipped with 232L NAND are going to be relatively sparse for this year, and will pick up in 2023 following the volume ramp. So while Micron’s 232L NAND is indeed shipping, from a consumer standpoint we’re likely still several months off (or more) from seeing it becoming a common fixture in SSDs and other products."]},

As a result, the company will also be producing 2242 form factor drives in all three capacities, while the smallest 2230 form factor drive will be available in 512GB and 1TB capacities. These smaller drives are only intended for the OEM market, however, so while the 2280 drive will be sold both at retail and to OEMs, only the latter will be able to officially get their hands on the shorter drive.", "Since Solidigm is still using the same 144L generation NAND for this newer product, the write endurance ratings are essentially unchanged from their previous generation products. That means a 200 TBW rating for the 512GB drive, and then 400 TBW and 800 TBW respectively for the 1TB and 2TB drives. Spread out over the 5 year warranty period for the drive, and this works out to about 0.2 drive writes per day, or an endurance rating of 400 P/E cycles.", "Overall, the rated performance of the P41 Plus is higher than the preceding 670p, primarily due to the controller changes. Even with a pSLC cache, the QLC NAND is only barely fast enough to warrant PCIe 4.0 connectivity, though the sequential reads can hit 4125MB/sec. This makes for modest increases in sequential throughput, while offering a more significant improvement in random IOPS (at least as far as official ratings go).", "Finally, it’s worth noting that the “P41” name is not a coincidence, despite the fact that it’s already in use elsewhere. While Solidigm is a subsidiary of SK hynix, it is part of the mega memory firm all the same. And while SK hynix’s own internal retail efforts are separate from Solidigm right now, that won’t always be the case. So, even if slowly, SK hynix is making preparations for a day where they have a single retail brand.", "The end result is that the P41 Plus has been named to go along with SK hynix’s own ", " – or as it's more commonly known, just the P41. To be sure, the drives have absolutely nothing in common – everything from the NAND to the controller to the market segment is different – but SK hynix is prepared to offer them together, if they decide to go that route. Unfortunately, this is a dubious decision from a customer standpoint; whereas the (Platinum) P41 is a flagship-level drive designed for high performance, the P41 Plus is a the very opposite end of the spectrum – very “plus” indeed. Generally, suffixes are used to denote superior hardware, so it’s a very unusual day when it’s the other way around.", "The hardware aside, the other major aspect of the P41 Plus – and certainly the most novel – is Solidigm’s latest attempt at cache tiering. While the company is not the first vendor to try using a pSLC write cache as a read cache as well (the Enmotus FuzeDrive takes those honors), this is the first time Solidigm has gone this route. And it’s certainly the highest profile attempt at the technique yet.", "As with the Optane Memory series of drives and the Enmotus drive, the basic idea behind having a read cache is to further improve the performance of a drive with otherwise slow NAND. While going with progressively finer multi-level cells within NAND causes write performance to drop off far faster than read performance, there is still a hit. This is especially the case when it comes to random reads as well as low queue depth operations that can’t fully exploit the parallelism present in a SSD. And unfortunately, that also describes client workloads to a T.", "Solidigm’s solution, then, is to treat the pSLC cache not as a write cache that’s merely used to buffer small amounts of data before it can be written to the slower QLC NAND, but rather to use the pSLC cache as a hot cache for reads and writes. That means keeping hot data (LBAs) on the pSLC cache, and only sending data to the QLC portion of the NAND when it’s either deemed no longer hot, or when the space is required (e.g. the pSLC portion is being shrunk). This works out to being very similar to how the Optane Memory H20 and its ilk operated, just replacing the Optane cache with the pSLC NAND.", "The good news is that from a technical standpoint, this significantly simplifies the construction (and abstraction) of the drive. Whereas the Optane Memory H20 had the unfortunate need to show up and operate as two drives – one Optane, one QLC – the P41 Plus shows up as a single SSD. And rather than talking to two SSDs, Solidigm merely needs to provide hints to the drive’s firmware to let it know what data it should consider hot. This shuffles more of the workload behind cache tiering on to the drive controller itself.", "The bad news is that special software/drivers are still required to identify hot data and provide directions to the drive controller. And that software, in turn, is Windows-only. So while the P41 Plus will work on Linux boxes and other machines, to benefit at all from Solidigm’s read caching, it needs to be running on a Windows host with Solidigm’s driver.", "For the launch of the P41 Plus, Solidigm is (re)branding their software suite as Solidigm Synergy. This is comprised of their storage driver, as well as a separate storage tool that offers drive health monitoring and other SSD toolbox features. The company also refers to their overall cache tiering feature as Synergy, so the feature and the software components should not be confused.", "The upshot there is that Solidigm has significant experience with caching (and caching drivers) at this point. So the company should be able to leverage the experience and code it already has from earlier products to develop their caching storage driver, as opposed to needing to come up with everything from scratch.", "According to Solidigm, they do not set aside any space on the P41 Plus specifically to hold hot data for reads. So the entire capacity of the drive is always available for access, with the size of the pSLC cache dynamically altered based on how much of the drive’s capacity is in use. And while we don’t have detailed figures for each capacity of the drive, Solidigm has indicated that they only do read caching when the drive is less than half-full. After the drive is half-full, the drive shifts to operating like a more traditional QLC SSD, favoring the diminishing pSLC space for writes to reduce the painful penalty of writing directly to QLC. For the 512GB drive, the pSLC cache will go down as low as 8GB if the drive is filled, and while we don’t have formal figures for the other drives, 16GB and 32GB respectively are reasonable guesses.", "As for the effectiveness of Solidigm’s read caching, based on what we’ve seen with the Optane Memory H20 and similar drives, there’s little reason to doubt that this works, at least to an extent. While detailed reviews will be needed to sort out the full performance range of the drive, we’ve already seen that throwing a fast cache in front of a DRAM-equipped QLC drive can improve performance, especially in workloads where the hot data is easily identified. The catch will be that QLC in pSLC mode is not 3D XPoint, so while it’s faster than QLC, it won’t be able to offer the same kind of absurd random read performance as Intel’s soon-to-be-retired phase change memory.", "Solidigm’s own promotional material shows modest improvements. Mixed read/write (70/30) workloads at QD1 measured with iometer show a 66% improvement in IOPS, reaching 25K. Pure random reads improve a bit more, going up by 72% to around 18K IOPS.", "To be sure, neither of these figures is ", ", however for a QLC drive they are respectable, and above what the more traditional drives like the 670p have delivered in our testing.", "Solidigm also has some slightly more real-world benchmarks, which have the P41 Plus performing well in the very cache-friendly PCMark 10 Full System Drive test. Solidigm also includes an unnamed TLC drive, but without more information it’s hard to say anything of value – or even confirm if it was a meaningful test.", "A win for Solidigm, in any case, doesn’t mean delivering chart-topping performance. If the P41 can hide the lack of DRAM and still being able to beat other QLC/TLC drives that are competing in the value segment alongside the P41 Plus, then that’s a win for Solidigm.", "Wrapping things up, while Solidigm isn’t announcing a launch date for the P41 Plus this morning, based on early retail listings we should expect to see the new QLC drive family sooner than later. The big question, as is usually the case with QLC drives, is at what price. QLC drives are still at a fundamental technical disadvantage compared to TLC drives, so even with the potential benefits of a better caching solution, the P41 Plus family still needs to be priced competitively. As with Intel and Solidigm’s previous QLC drives, pricing is going to make or break things in the retail market.", ": Solidigm has announced pricing for the new drives. The 512GB drive will be priced at $49.99, the 1TB drive at $89.99, and the 2TB drive at $169.99. The drives will go on sale August 22", "."]},

Showcasing for the first time the company’s forthcoming 238 layer TLC NAND, which promises both improved density/capacity and improved bandwidth. At 238 layers, SK hynix has, at least for the moment, secured bragging rights for the greatest number of layers in a TLC NAND die – though with mass production not set to begin until 2023, it’s going to be a while until the company’s newest NAND shows up in retail products.", "Following closely on the heels of ", ", SK hynix is upping the ante ever so slightly with a 238 layer design. Though the difference in layer counts is largely inconsequential when you’re talking about NAND dies with 200+ layers to begin with, in the highly competitive flash memory industry it gives SK hynix bragging rights on layer counts, breaking the previous stalemate between them, Samsung, and Micron at 176L.", "From a technical perspective, SK hynix’s 238L NAND further builds upon the basic design of ", ". So we’re once again looking at a string stacked design, with SH hynix using a pair of 119 layer decks, up from 88 layers in the previous generation. This makes SK hynix the third flash memory vendor to master building decks over 100 layers tall, and is what’s enabling them to produce a 238L NAND design that holds the line at two decks.", "SK hynix’s NAND decks continue to be built with their charge-trap, CMOS under Array (CuA) architecture, which sees the bulk of the NAND’s logic placed under the NAND memory cells. According to the company, their initial 512Gbit TLC part has a die size of 35.58mm", ", which works out to a density of roughly 14.39 Gbit/mm", ". That’s a 35% improvement in density over their previous-generation 176L TLC NAND die at equivalent capacities. Notably, this does mean that SK hynix will be ever so slightly trailing Micron’s 232L NAND despite their total layer count advantage, as Micron claims they’ve hit a density of 14.6 Gbit/mm", "on their 1Tbit dies.", "Speaking of 1Tbit, unlike Micron, SK hynix is not using the density improvements to build higher capacity dies – at least, not yet. While the company has announced that they will be building 1Tbit dies next year using their 238L process, for now they’re holding at 512Gbit, the same capacity as their previous generation. So all other factors held equal, we shouldn’t expect the first wave drives built using 238L NAND to have any greater capacity than the current generation. But, if nothing else, at least SK hynix’s initial 238L dies are quite small – though whether that translates at all to smaller packages remains to be seen.", "Besides density improvements, SK hynix has also improved the performance and power consumption of their NAND. Like the other NAND vendors, SK hynix is using this upcoming generation of NAND to introduce ONFi 5.0 support. ONFi 5.0 is notable for not only increasing the top transfer rate to 2400MT/second – a 50% improvement over ONFi 4.2 – but it also introduces a new NV-LPDDR4 signaling method. As it’s based on LPDDR signaling (unlike the DDR3-derrived mode in ONFi 4.x), NV-LPDDR4 offers tangible reductions in the amount of power consumed by NAND signaling. SK hynix isn’t breaking their power consumption figures out to this level of detail, but for overall power consumption, they’re touting a 21% reduction in energy consumed for read operations. Presumably this is per bit, so it will be counterbalanced by the 50% improvement in bandwidth.", "This week’s announcement comes as SK hynix has begun shipping samples of the 238L NAND to their customers. As previously mentioned, the company is not planning on kicking off mass production until H1’2023, so it will be some time before we see the new NAND show up in retail products. According to SK hynix, their plan is to start with shipping NAND for consumer SSDs, followed by smartphones and high-capacity server SSDs. That, in turn, will be followed up with the introduction of 1Tbit 238L NAND later in 2023."]},

{"title": "Microsoft: DirectStorage 1.1 with GPU Decompression Finally on Its Way", "paragraph": ["As part of this week’s Microsoft Ignite developers conference, Microsoft’s DirectX team has published a few blog posts offering updates on the state of various game development-related projects. The biggest and most interesting of these is an update on DirectStorage, Microsoft’s API for enabling faster game asset loading. In short, the long-awaited 1.1 update, which adds support for GPU asset decompression, is finally on its way, with Microsoft intending to release the API to developers by the end of this year.", "As a quick refresher, ", " is Microsoft’s next-generation game asset loading API, and is designed to take advantage of the modern capabilities of both GPUs and storage hardware to allow for game assets to be more efficiently transferred directly to GPU. On the I/O side of matters, DirectStorage offers new batched I/O operations that are designed to cut down on the number of individual I/O operations, reducing the overall I/O overhead. But more even more notable than that, DirectStorage also enables (or rather, will enable) GPU asset decompression, allowing for modern compressed assets to bypass the CPU and be decompressed on the GPU instead.", "The significance of DirectStorage is that Microsoft wants PCs (and console) to be able to better leverage the low random access times and high transfer rates of modern SSDs, enabling games to quickly stream in new assets rather than having to pre-load everything or suffering noticeably slow asset loading, as can be the case today. Under current game development paradigms, the CPU can be a bottlenecking factor in scaling up I/O rates to meet what SSDs can provide, as there are significant CPU costs both to tracking so many I/O operations and for decompressing game assets before passing them on to the GPU. DirectStorage, in turn, is designed to minimize both of these loads, and ultimately, try to remove the CPU as much as possible from game asset streaming.  ", "DirectStorage technology was already implemented on Microsoft/s Xbox Series X/S consoles for their launch in 2020, so more recent efforts have been around porting DirectStorage to Windows and accounting for the non-homogenous hardware ecosystem. Earlier this year Microsoft rolled out DirectStorage 1.0, which implemented the I/O batching improvements, but not the GPU decompression capabilities. This is where DirectStorage 1.1 will come in, as it will finally be enabling the second (and most important) aspect of DirectStorage for PCs.", "By allowing GPUs to do game asset decompression, that entire process is offloaded from the CPU. This not only frees the CPU up for other tasks, but it removes a potentially critical bottleneck in game asset streaming. Because modern SSDs are so fast – on the order of hundreds of thousands of IOPS and data transfer rates hitting 7GB/second – the CPU is the weakest link between speedy SSDs and massively parallel GPUs. So under DirectStorage, the CPU is getting cut out almost entirely.", "As far as the performance benefits of DirectStorage 1.1 go, the full gains will depend on both the hardware used and how much data a game or other application is attempting to push. Games moving large amounts of data on very fast systems are expected to see the largest gains from the full DirectStorage 1.1 stack, though even lighter games can benefit from the fast access times to NVMe SSDs.", "As part of Microsoft’s blog post, the company posted a screenshot from their Bulk Loading sample program for game developers, which offers a simple demonstration and benchmark of DirectStorage 1.1 in action. In Microsoft’s case, they were able to load 5.65GB of assets in 0.8 seconds using GPU decompression on an undisclosed PC, versus 2.36 seconds on the same system with CPU decompression – while maxing out the load on the CPU in the process. Like most SDK sample programs, this is a simple test case focused on just one feature, so the real-world gains aren’t likely to be quite so extreme, but it underscores the performance benefits of moving asset decompression from the CPU to the GPU when you have a large amount of asset data.", "Moving under the hood, DirectStorage GPU decompression is being enabled via the introduction GDeflate, a general purpose compression algorithm that was ", ". GDeflate is a GPU-optimized variation on Deflate, which has been designed to better mesh with the massively parallel (and not-very-serial) nature of GPUs.", "DirectStorage, in turn, will be implementing GDeflate support in two different manners. The first (and preferred) manner is to pass things off to the GPU drivers and have the GPU vendor take care of it as they see fit. This will allow hardware vendors optimize for the specific hardware/architecture used, and leverage any special hardware processing blocks if they’re available. All three companies are eager to get the show on the road, and it's likely some (if not all) of them will have DirectStorage 1.1-capable drivers ready before the API even ships to game developers.", "Failing that, Microsoft is also providing a generic (but optimized) DirectCompute GDeflate decompressor, which can be run on any DirectX12 Shader Model 6.0-compliant GPU. Which means that, in some form or another, GDeflate will be available with virtually any PC GPU made in the last 10 years – though more recent GPUs are expected to offer much better performance.", "Otherwise, the only things that will eventually be needed to take advantage of GPU decompression – and DirectStorage 1.1 in general – will be Windows 10 1909 (or later) or Windows 11, as well as a fast storage device. Technically, DirectStorage works against any storage device, including SATA SSDs, but it is explicitly being optimized for (and deliver the best results on) systems using NVMe SSDs.", "Do note, however, that it will be up to individual games to implement DirectStorage to see the benefits of the API. That means not only using the necessary API hooks, but also shipping games with assets packed using the new GDeflate algorithm. The vast backwards compatibility of GDeflate means that game devs can essentially hit the ground running here on DX12 games – anything worth running a new game on is going to support DirectStorage and GDeflate – but the fact that it involves game assets means that full DirectStorage 1.1 support cannot be trivially added to existing games. Developers would need to redistribute (or otherwise recompress) game assets for GDeflate, which is certainly do-able, but would require gamers to re-download a large part of a game. So gamers should plan on seeing DirectStorage 1.1 arrive as a feature in future games, rather than backported into existing games.", "Finally, as for Microsoft’s audience at hand (developers), this week’s announcement from Microsoft is meant to prod them into getting ready for the updated API ahead of its release later this year. Microsoft isn’t releasing the API documentation or tools at this time, but they are encouraging developers to get started with DirectStorage 1.0, so that they can take the next step and add GPU decompression once 1.1 is available later this year."]},

While QNAP only provided a teaser of the capabilities, there are a couple of points worth talking about to get an idea of where the COTS NAS market is headed towards in the near future.", "Network-Attached storage units have typically been based on either server platforms in the SMB / SME space or single-board computer (SBC) platforms in the home consumer / SOHO space. Traditionally, both platforms have eschewed big.LITTLE / hybrid processors for a variety of reasons. In the x86 space, we saw hybrid processors entering the mainstream market recently with Intel's Alder Lake family. In the ARM world, big.LITTLE has been around for a relatively longer time. However, server workloads are typically unsuitable for that type of architecture. Without a credible use-case for such processors, it is also unlikely that servers will go that route. However, SBCs are a different case, and we have seen a number of application processors adopting the big.LITTLE strategy getting used in that market segment.", "Both the all-flash TBS-574X and the AI NAS TS-AI642 are based on hybrid processors.

The RAM specifications were not provided - SoC specs indicate LPDDR4, but we have reached out to QNAP for the exact amount . There are six drive bays. This is again interesting, since the SoC natively offers only up to 3 SATA ports. So, QNAP is either using a port multiplier or a separate SATA controller connected to the PCIe lanes for this purpose. The SoC's native network support is restricted to dual GbE ports, but QNAP is including 2.5 GbE as well as a PCIe Gen 3 slot for 10 GbE expansion. These are also bound to take up the limited number of PCIe lanes in the processor (which is 4x PCIe 3.0, configurable as 1 x4, or 2 x2, or 4 x1). Overall, the hardware is quite interesting in terms of how QNAP will be able to manage performance expectations with the SoC's capabilities. With a focus on surveillance deployments and cloud storage integration, the performance may be good enough even with port multipliers.", "Overall, QNAP's teaser of their two upcoming desktop NAS products has provided us with insights into where the NAS market for SOHOs / SMBs is headed in the near future. QNAP has never shied away from exploring new hardware options, unlike Synology, QSAN, Terramaster, and the like. While we are very bullish on E1.S support and hybrid processors in desktop NAS units, the appeal of the RockChip-based AI NAS may depend heavily on its price to capabilities / performance aspect."]},

However, that doesn't mean consumers should run the MP700 au naturel since the SSD will likely suffer thermal throttling. Therefore, the recommendation is to use the motherboard's integrated M.2 heatsink or an aftermarket M.2 SSD cooler with the MP700 to ensure optimal operation.

As per Solidigm's own marketing material, there is no free lunch. QLC does come with downsides in terms of slow sustained sequential writes (compared to TLC). The D5-P5316 also opted to increase the indirection unit from 4K to 64K. While this allows easier flash management, 4K random writes are greatly impacted due to latency increase from repeated access to the indirection table as well as excessive write amplification.

Solidigm actually suggests adapting the software to avoid 4K random writes, or using the drive only for workloads that are either read-intensive or with large block sequential / random writes. Those types of workloads greatly lower the I/O amplification, this addressing the endurance aspect.

The BG6 series continues the DRAMless strategy and dual-chip design (separate controller and flash packages) of the BG5.", "While the performance numbers for the BG5 strictly placed it in the entry-level category for PCIe 4.0 SSDs, the update to the NAND has now amplified the performance to accepted mainstream levels for this segment. The DRAMless nature and use of the system DRAM (host memory buffer - HMB) for storing the flash translation layer (FTL) handicaps the performance slightly, preventing it from reaching high-end specifications.

The E31T is based around multiple Arm Cortex R5 cores for realtime operations, and in Phison designs these are traditionally accompanied by special-purpose accelerators that belong to the company's CoXProcessor package. The chip supports Phison's 7", " Generation LDPC engine with RAID ECC and 4K code word to handle the latest and upcoming 3D TLC and 3D QLC types of 3D NAND. The controller also supports AES-256, TCG Opal, and TCG Pyrite security.", "The SSD controller is organized in four NAND channels with 16 chip enable lines (CEs) each, allowing it to address 16 NAND dies per channel. For now Phison is refraining from disclosing NAND interface speeds the controller supports, though given the fact that the controller is set to support sequential read/write throughput of 10,800 MB/s over four channels, napkin math indicates they'll need to support transfer rates of at least 2700 MT/s. This is on the upper-end of current ONFi/Toggle standards, but still readily attained. For example, Kioxia's and Western Digital's latest 218-layer BICS 3D NAND devices support a 3200 MT/s interface speed (which provides a peak sequential read/write speed of 400 MB/s).", "Phison says that its E31T controller will enable M.2-2280 SSDs with a PCIe 5.0 x4 interface and a capacities of up to 8 TB. Phison's DRAM-less controllers tend to remain in use in SSD designs for quite a while due to their mainstream posiitoning and relatively cheap price, so, unsurprisingly, Phison traditionally opts to plan for the long term with regards to capacity. 8 TB SSDs will eventually come down in price, even if they aren't here quite yet.", "Compared to the high-end E26 controller, the E31T supports fewer NAND channels and NAND dies overall, but enthusiasts will also want to take note of the manufacturing process Phison is using for the controller. Phison is scheduled to build the E31T on TSMC's 7nm process, which although is no longer-cutting edge, is a full generation ahead of the 12nm process used for the E26. So combined with the reduced complexity of the controller, this should bode well for cooler running and less power-hungry PCIe 5.0 SSDs.", "The smaller, mainstream-focused chip should also allow for those PCIe 5.0 SSDs to be cheaper. Though, as always, it should be noted that Phison doesn't publicly talk about controller pricing, let alone control what their customers (SSD vendors) charge for their finished drives.", "As for availability of drives based on Phison's new controller, as Phison has not yet announced an expected sampling date, you shouldn't expect to see E31T drives for a while. Phison typically announces new controllers fairly early in the SSD development process, so there's usually at least a several month gap before finished SSDs hit the market. Case in point: drives based on Phison's PCIe 4.0 E27T controller, which was announced at Computex 2022, are still not available. Otherwise, as Phison's second PCIe 5.0 controller, the E31T should hopefully encounter fewer teething issues than the initial E26, but we'd still expect E31T drives to be 2024 products."]},

The T700 was one of the first to offer more than 12 GBps read speeds, and the T705 being launched today is one of the first drives available for purchase in the 14+ GBps read speeds category.", "The Crucial T705 utilizes the same platform as the T700 from last year - Phison's E26 controller with Micron's B58R 232L 3D TLC NAND. The key difference is the B58R NAND operating at 2400 MT/s in the new T705 (compared to the 2000 MT/s in the T700). Micron's 232L NAND process has now matured enough for the company to put out 2400 MT/s versions with enough margins. Similar to the T700, this drive is targeted towards gamers, content creators, and professional users as well as data-heavy AI use-cases.", "The move to 2400 MT/s NAND has allowed Crucial to claim an increase in the performance of the drive in all four corners - up to 20% faster random writes, and 18% higher sequential reads. Additionally, Crucial also claims more bandwidth in a similar power window for the new drive.", "The T705 is launching in three capacities - 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB. Both heatsink and non-heatsink versions are available. Crucial is also offering a white heatsink limited edition for the 2TB version. This caters to users with white-themed motherboards that are increasingly gaining market presence.", "Phison has been pushing DirectStorage optimizations in its high-end controllers, and it is no surprise that the T705 advertises the use of Phison's 'I/O+ Technology' to appeal to gamers. Given its high-performance nature, it is no surprise that the E26 controller needs to be equipped with DRAM for managing the flash translation layer (FTL). Crucial is using Micron LPDDR4 DRAM (1GB / TB of flash) in the T705 for this purpose.", "Crucial is confident that the supplied passive heatsink is enough to keep the T705 from heavy throttling under extended use. The firmware throttling kicks in at 81C and protective shutdown at 90C. Flash pricing is not quite as low as it was last year, and the 2400 MT/s flash allows Micron / Crucial to place a premium on the product. At the 4TB capacity point, the drive can be purchased for as low as 18¢/GB, but the traditional 1TB and 2TB ones go for 20 - 26 ¢/GB depending on the heatsink option.", "There are a number of Gen5 consumer SSDs slated to appear in the market over the next few months using the same 2400 MT/s B58R 3D TLC NAND and Phison's E26 controller (Sabrent's Rocket 5 is one such drive). The Crucial / Micron vertical integration on the NAND front may offer some advantage for the T705 when it comes to the pricing aspect against such SSDs. That said, the Gen5 consumer SSD market is still in its infancy with only one mass market (Phison E26) controller in the picture. The rise in consumer demand for these high-performance SSDs may coincide with other vendors such as ", " and ", " gaining traction. Currently, Crucial / Micron (with their Phison partnership) is the only Tier-1 vendor with a high-performance consumer Gen5 SSD portfolio, and the T705 cements their leadership position in the category further."]},

Driving this gains, the company cites the miniaturization of the cell size, as well as the integration of enhanced memory cell technologies that reduce interference and extend the lifespan of the cells. With their latest NAND technology, Samsung has also been able to eliminate dummy channel holes, thus reducing the planar area of the memory cells.", "Interestingly, today's announcement also marks the first time that Samsung has publicly confirmed their use of string stacking in their NAND, referring to it as their double-stack structure. The company is widely believed to have been using sting stacking back in their 8th generation NAND as well, however this was never confirmed by the company. Regardless, the use of string stacking is only going to increase from here, as vendors look to keep adding layers to their NAND dies, while manufacturing variability and channel hole tolerances make it difficult to produce more than 150-200 layers in a single stack.", "Speaking of channel holes, another key technological enhancement in the 9th gen V-NAND is Samsung's advanced 'channel hole etching' technology.

But it looks like the situation is going to change in the coming quarters, as SSDs based on Phison's PS5031-E31T controller are incoming, with at least one Phison customer demoing an E31T drive on the Computex show floor.", "Phison's PS5031-E31T controller uses two Arm Cortex-R5 cores accelerated by the Andes N25 CoXProcessor, just like its bigger brother Phison PS5026-E26. But this is where their major hardware similarities seem to end. The new E31T controller is a DRAM-less controller with four NAND channels (16 CE targets) that is produced on one of TSMC's 7nm processes, whereas the E26 is an eight-channel controller made on TSMC's 12nm production node.", "Besides cutting down on memory channels and the use of DRAM to drive down costs, the E31T also picks up a couple of new tricks by virtue of being nearly two years newer. In particular, the E31T sports Phison's 7th Generation LDPC error correction technology, as opposed to the E25's 5th-gen LDPC", "Phison itself calls its E31T platform 'the first mainstream 10 GB/s platform,' which pretty much gives a performance indicator for some of the upcoming inexpensive PCIe Gen5 SSDs.

The controller's NAND support is quite modern, however, supporting the latest ONFI/Toggle standards, which will allow it to hit NAND transfer rates up to 3600 MT/second. Across four channels, that's enough bandwidth to fully saturate a PCIe 4.0 x4 connection with sequential read/writes, while random 4K IOPS can burst as high as 1.2 million. Engineering samples of the controller are set to emerge in Q4 2024, so do not expect actual drives based on this chip to emerge for sale until the second half of next year at the earliest.", "Realtek is also preparing the RTS5781DL, which can be thought of as a PCIe 5.0 version of their DRAM-less controller platform. The RTS5781DL features the same four-channel NAND layout and 3600 MT/sec max NAND transfer rates, which with the additional bandwidth afforded by PCIe 5.0, shifts the performance bottleneck back to the NAND. Overall, Realtek expects drives with its first PCIe Gen5 SSD controller to hit sustained transfer rates up to 10GB/second, and up to 1.4 million random read/write IOPS. The company aims to make engineering samples of this controller available in the first quarter of 2025, so actual drives will hit the market in late 2025 at best.", "Finally, the pinnacle of Realtek's roadmap will be its RTS5782, which is the company's first high-end SSD controller. Besides including support for on-drive DRAM (DDR4/LPDDR4X) for higher performance, the back-end of the RTS5782 will feature an eight NAND channel design that supports transfer rates up to 3600 MT/second. Drives built with the controller are expected to be able to sustain 14GB/second sequential read rates and 12GB/second sequential writes, while the 4K random IOPS performance jumps to 2.5 million 4K read and write IOPS.", "Unfortunately, the RTS5782 is also the farthest out of the three controllers, as it's still in the planning stages at Realtek.
