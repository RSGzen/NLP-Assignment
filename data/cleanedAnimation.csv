0,Inside Out: 2,2024,"Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Family, Fantasy","Two years after her move to San Francisco,[d] 13-year-old Riley Andersen is entering high school. Her personified emotions Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger now oversee a newly formed element of Riley's mind called her ""Sense of Self"", which houses memories and feelings that shape Riley's beliefs. Joy, aiming to fill the Sense of Self with only good memories, has created a mechanism that launches bad memories to the back of Riley's mind. Riley and her best friends, Bree and Grace, are invited to a three-day ice hockey camp, where Riley hopes to qualify for her new school's team, the Fire Hawks. In Headquarters, a ""puberty alarm"" from the previous movie goes off the night before camp, and several mind workers abruptly upgrade the emotion console, leaving Headquarters in disarray. The emotions find that Riley now overreacts to any inputs they make to the console. Four new emotions Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui arrive and clash with the original emotions over their approaches. In particular, Joy wants Riley to have fun at camp, while Anxiety focuses on winning a spot on the team and making new friends, especially after Riley learns that Bree and Grace will be attending a different high school. Under Joy's control, Riley inadvertently gets the campers in trouble by the strict camp director, Coach Roberts. Anxiety, deciding that Riley needs to change to fit in with the older players, launches the Sense of Self to the back of the mind and has the old emotions bottled up and thrown into a memory vault. The new emotions then create a new anxiety-dominated Sense of Self and encourage Riley to befriend popular hockey player Valentina ""Val"" Ortiz, straining her friendship with Bree and Grace. After the original emotions escape the vault, Joy sends Sadness back to Headquarters with a two-way radio while she and the others retrieve the Sense of Self. Sadness is discovered by Embarrassment, who reluctantly helps her remain hidden, eventually helping her out. Under Anxiety's control, Riley sneaks into Coach Roberts' office and learns from her notebook that Riley is not considered ready yet to become a Fire Hawk. The four original emotions find the old Sense of Self on a mountain of bad memories deposited by Joy's mechanism. Anxiety, overhearing Joy's plan through the two-way radio, destroys the recall tube, keeping Joy and the others trapped in the back of the mind. Joy blows up the cliff full of bad memories, sending them careening into Riley's Belief System while she and the emotions ride it to return to Headquarters. Anxiety realizes her plan to create a new Sense of Self has backfired, having generated one of self-doubt and inferiority, which causes Riley to perform poorly during her final tryout match, accidentally crash into Grace, and get sent to the penalty box. Horrified, Anxiety frantically swarms the console in a blinding whirlwind, causing Riley to have an anxiety attack. Returning to Headquarters, Joy finds Anxiety still in control but heavily stressed out; Joy convinces her that Riley doesn't need to change to have a better future. Anxiety relents and Joy reinstates Riley's original Sense of Self, but the panic attack persists. Anxiety apologizes to Joy, and reveals that neither she, nor any of the emotions, gets to choose who Riley is. Joy, realizing that Anxiety is telling the truth, removes the first Sense of Self, allowing a new one to form from both Riley's good and bad memories. The emotions embrace this third self, calming Riley and helping her reconcile with Bree and Grace. The console calls for Joy, who takes command and helps Riley happily finish the hockey tryouts. Riley befriends Val and the other Fire Hawks at high school, while maintaining her friendship with Bree and Grace. Living in peace, the nine emotions work together to protect Riley, as she happily checks her phone for the Fire Hawks' recruitment results.",Kelsey Mann,"Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman"

The lukewarm success and massive property damage prompt the government to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, ending financial assistance for the ""supers"". Violet's classmate and love interest, Tony Rydinger, discovers her superhero identity; Agent Rick Dicker accidentally erases Tony's entire knowledge of Violet instead of just this incident. Wealthy siblings Winston and Evelyn Deavor, who run the telecommunications company DevTech, propose secret missions to Helen (alias Elastigirl), Bob (alias Mr. Incredible), and Lucius. These are to be recorded and broadcast in a movement to regain public trust in superheroes. Winston chooses Helen for their initial missions as she has caused the least property damage. Initially reluctant to be away from her family and risking getting into trouble with the law, Helen accepts after a talk with Bob. Winston rehouses the Parrs in a luxury mansion. Bob struggles in his new role as a stay-at-home parent, left to deal with Violet's dejection over Tony forgetting their first date, Dash's math homework, and the chaos of baby Jack-Jack's burgeoning superpowers. He suppresses envy for Helen and, at Lucius's advice, calls on Edna Mode to babysit Jack-Jack. Meanwhile, in the city of New Urbem, Helen encounters the supervillain Screenslaver, a hacker who can perform hypnosis through any screen. After preventing him from destroying a crowded hovertrain and thwarting his assassination attempt on an ambassador, she tracks his signals and infiltrates his base. Defeating him, she unmasks him only to discover a disoriented pizza delivery driver, who is bewildered at his detainment. At a party celebrating Helen's success, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize the ""supers"" on live television, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the Everjust, and attended by all ""supers"" coming out of hiding. Helen realizes Screenslaver lured her to a decoy double, and the pizza delivery driver was under the control of hypnotic goggles. Evelyn reveals herself to be the true Screenslaver and captures Helen, restraining her using her goggles and a freezing cell that negates her self-stretching superpower. Evelyn blames society's overdependence on the ""supers"" for the deaths of her and Winston's parents, as their father was shot by burglars after the newly outlawed supers Fironic and Gazerbeam did not answer his calls for aid, and their mother died of grief. Evelyn plans to sabotage her brother's summit to ruin the reputation of all ""supers"" once more and keep them outlawed in the hopes that the public will be safer with self-sufficient crimefighting. Evelyn lures Bob into a trap on the Everjust, goggling him, and sends a squadron of hypnotized supers to subdue Violet and Dash. Lucius arrives to protect them but is overwhelmed and goggled. Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack escape in a refurbished Incredibile, the supercar once owned by Bob, and, deducing their parents' peril, stow away on the Everjust. Onboard, Helen, Bob, and Lucius are forced to broadcast themselves, giving villainous speeches, subduing the ship s crew, and locking its course towards New Urbem at a disastrous pace. The children arrive; Jack-Jack removes the goggles on Helen, who in turn frees Bob and Lucius. They work together to release the other mind-controlled supers and safely prevent the Everjust's collision with the city. Evelyn escapes in the yacht's parasite jet, but is caught by Helen and arrested. With another disaster averted and the positive publicity surrounding this, ""supers"" around the world regain their legal, respected status just as Winston hoped. Sometime later, Tony is picked up by Violet and her family in the Incredibile for their reinstated movie date. They spot a police chase; Violet leaves Tony at the cinema, promising a quick return, before the Parrs enthusiastically don their superhero masks and join the pursuit.a",Brad Bird,"Craig T.

5,Frozen II,2019,"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","King Agnarr of Arendelle tells his daughters Elsa and Anna that their grandfather, King Runeard, forged a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in their homeland, the Enchanted Forest. A fight occurred, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the forest's classical elements of earth, fire, water, and air. The elements disappeared, and a wall of mist trapped everyone in the forest; Agnarr barely escaped, helped by an unknown savior. Three years after her coronation,[b] Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, the snowman Olaf, the iceman Kristoff, and Kristoff's reindeer Sven.

Anna and Elsa arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved the Arendellian Agnarr. The Northuldra tell them about a fifth spirit, who is meant to reunite the people with the magic of nature. While Kristoff and Sven stay with the Northuldra, Elsa, Anna, and Olaf continue north.

Believing she should continue alone, Elsa sends Anna and Olaf to safety despite Anna's protests. She encounters and tames the N kk, the water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her is the memory of young Iduna and that her powers are a gift from nature because of Iduna's selfless saving of Agnarr. Venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan, she learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce Northuldran resources because of Runeard's contempt for the tribe's connection with magic, and that he began the conflict by murdering the Northuldran leader in cold blood. Elsa relays this information to Anna before freezing solid, which in turn causes Olaf to fade away from existence. Upon discovering the truth, Anna concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored and the forest to be freed. She awakens the earth spirit, J tunn, and lures it towards the dam.

On her return from one such voyage, Moana is given the title of tautai, or master wayfinder   Motunui s first tautai in a thousand years. In a vision, Moana s ancestor, Tautai Vasa, reveals why none of those people are connected anymore: the malicious storm god Nalo wanted power over the mortals, so he sunk a legendary island called Motufetu, which connected all islands, down to the depths of the ocean. Vasa further warns that the people of Motunui will go extinct in the future if Moana cannot find a way to raise Motufetu. In response to this call from the ancestors, Moana assembles a crew of people from Motunui   craftswoman Loto, historian Moni, and grumpy elderly farmer Kele, alongside her pet pig and rooster, Pua and Heihei   to follow the path of a comet across the ocean towards Motufetu. Meanwhile, Maui is seeking Motufetu himself since he had a previous quarrel with Nalo, but he is captured by Nalo's enforcer, Matangi. Maui is reluctant to contact Moana, as he fears she may not survive if she comes to help. Moana and her crew are captured by the Kakamora, a tribe of savage coconut-like pirates that Moana previously encountered, who reveal that Nalo's actions against Motufetu had caused them to be disconnected from their home island. A Kakamora named Kotu helps the crew paralyze a gargantuan monster clam inside of which is Matangi's lair. While the crew finds Maui, Moana meets Matangi and learns that she is not happy serving Nalo. Matangi helps Moana escape and reunite with Maui and her friends, before sending them to where Nalo is. Maui warns that Nalo's realm is deadlier compared to the mortal realm and that fighting him will spell certain death for mere mortals. Nalo's monsters ambush the group, damaging their raft and washing them ashore on an isolated island. Moana begins to despair, but Maui encourages her to keep on going. With Moana revitalized, the group plans to have Maui raise Motufetu so that Moana can touch it, as that is the only way to stop Nalo. Her crew repairs her raft, but when the group ventures forth to confront Nalo, they encounter a gigantic storm. Moana, realizing that Nalo is trying to stop humans from breaking the curse, asks Maui to lift Motufetu enough for her to touch it. As Maui begins to pull up Motufetu with his giant hook, Nalo strips Maui of his demigod powers with a lightning bolt. Moana, in a moment of desperation, dives into the ocean to touch Motufetu underwater, but as she succeeds, Nalo's lightning kills her. Maui jumps in after her body, and with a magical chant, summons the spirits of Tautai Vasa and Moana's ancestors, including her grandmother Tala, who help revive her as a demigoddess, with Moana gaining a wayfinder's tattoo. Maui, also regaining his powers as a demigod, finally raises Motufetu and helps Moana reconnect the people with the ocean. The crew returns home to Motunui, leading a flotilla of the peoples of the ocean, and a celebration is held in Moana's honor. In a mid-credits scene, Nalo plans his revenge and is about to punish Matangi for helping Moana, when the giant crab Tamatoa arrives to join his cause.","David G.

The next day, Scar lures Simba into a gorge and signals the hyenas to drive a large herd of wildebeests into a stampede to trample him. Scar alerts Mufasa, who manages to save Simba and tries to escape the gorge; he begs Scar for help, but Scar betrays him by throwing him into the stampede to his death. Scar then deceives Simba into believing that Mufasa's death was his fault and tells him to leave the Pride Lands and never return. He then orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but Simba escapes, and they decide not to tell him of it. Unaware of Simba's survival, Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba are dead, and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands, much to the shock of the pride and the sadness of Rafiki. Simba collapses in a desert, but is rescued by two other outcasts; a meerkat and a warthog named Timon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who is revealed to be Nala. After reconciling, Simba and Nala end up falling in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become a desolate wasteland under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and leaves angrily. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa s spirit lives on in him. Simba is then visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands. Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who shames Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa s death. Just before he could throw him into a great fire that was made by lightning, Scar then arrogantly reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the pride. A battle ensues between Simba and his allies and the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to deceive Simba by blaming his actions on the hyenas, who overhear him. Simba refuses to believe him, but spares Scar's life while banishing him from the Pride Lands forever. Scar pretends to accept this, but then attacks Simba. Following a brief battle, Simba throws Scar off the ledge. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, angry at him for betraying them, attack and maul him to death. With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his rightful place as king, with Nala as his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life.","Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff"," Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones"

George corners Gwen and she reveals her identity to him, and he attempts to arrest her before she leaves with Jess and Miguel. In Brooklyn on Earth-1610, 16 months after Kingpin's defeat and the destruction of the Alchemax collider,[a] Miles Morales is having trouble with his parents due to his duties as Spider-Man interfering with his personal life, and is grounded when he is late to a party celebrating his father Jeff's promotion to police captain. Miles encounters the Spot, an Alchemax scientist-turned-supervillain whose body was infused with portals during the explosion. The Spot blames Miles for causing his mutation and reveals that the radioactive spider that bit Miles and gave him his powers came from an alternate universe, Earth-42, while the Spot was testing the collider. The Spot accidentally transports himself into a void and learns to use his portals to travel to other universes and empower himself by using Alchemax colliders in other dimensions. Gwen travels to Miles' dimension, and they reconnect, sharing their struggles and hinting at feelings of attraction towards each other. Gwen secretly tracks the Spot and opens a portal to the next universe: Earth-50101. Miles discreetly follows Gwen into the portal, and the two team up with Earth-50101's local Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar, and later Hobie Brown, against the Spot.

They are about to become parents, waiting for their many eggs to hatch. Suddenly, a barracuda approaches the anemone; Coral rushes to protect her eggs as the barracuda knocks Marlin unconscious. Upon awakening, Marlin discovers that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda; the last remaining egg is cracked. Marlin names his child Nemo, a name Coral liked, and vows to keep him safe. On Nemo's first day of school, he and Marlin have a heated argument regarding Marlin's overprotective parenting method. Nemo defiantly swims to a speedboat and is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin frantically pursues the boat in vain. Marlin meets Dory, a blue tang with short-term memory loss, who offers to help him. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who are attempting to abstain from eating fish. Marlin finds a diver's mask that fell from the boat and accidentally injures Dory with it. The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a frenzy and he accidentally sets off old naval mines; the sharks, Marlin, and Dory are able to swim to safety before the mines blow up. Nemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney, Australia. He meets the ""Tank Gang"", led by Gill, a scarred Moorish idol. Sherman plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla, who accidentally killed her previous pet fish because she treated him carelessly. Gill, who also wishes to return to the ocean, devises an escape plan: Nemo, the smallest fish in the tank, will block the aquarium's filter tube with a pebble, obliging Sherman to put the fish into bags while he cleans the tank. This will allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to block the filter but fails; in the process, he is almost killed by the filter's machinery, causing Gill to feel deeply regretful. The diver's mask falls into a deep trench. As Marlin and Dory search for it, they are attacked by an anglerfish but manage to trap it using the mask. Dory memorizes the address written on the mask. A school of moonfish give the pair directions to the East Australian Current. On their way, Marlin and Dory become trapped in a forest of jellyfish. After being stung and knocked unconscious, they awaken in the East Australian Current with a large group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. The story of Marlin's quest is relayed by the turtles across the ocean to Sydney, where it reaches Nigel, a pelican who regularly converses with the Tank Gang. Nigel tells the Tank Gang of Marlin's journey, motivating Nemo to try blocking the filter again. Nemo's attempt is successful, and the aquarium quickly becomes covered in green algae. After exiting the current, Marlin and Dory get lost and are consumed by a blue whale. The whale expels them through its blowhole into Sydney Harbour. Nigel finds Marlin and Dory, and, after rescuing them from a flock of ravenous seagulls, takes them to Sherman's office, where Nemo is playing dead to avoid being given to Darla; this causes Marlin to believe Nemo is actually dead. Sherman forces Nigel out of his office, and Gill helps Nemo escape through the sink drain that leads to the ocean. Deeply shaken, Marlin mournfully says goodbye to Dory and begins heading home. Nemo meets Dory, who helps him reunite with Marlin. A fishing trawler captures Dory in a net along with a school of groupers. Nemo and Marlin work together, instructing the fish to swim down. Their combined force breaks the beam of the trawler, freeing the fish. Some time later, Marlin, who has become more confident and outgoing, drops Nemo off at school. Dory joins Marlin, and together, they wave goodbye to Nemo as he leaves with his class. Meanwhile, after the dentist's new filter breaks, the Tank Gang escapes into Sydney Harbour in their plastic bags. Now successfully in the ocean but still stuck in the bags, they ponder what to do next.","Andrew Stanton, Lee Unkrich","Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould"

19,Inside Out ,2015,"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","In the mind of a young girl named Riley Andersen are five personified emotions that influence her actions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Riley's experiences become memories that are stored as colored orbs and are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of the five most important ""core memories"" within her personality take the form of five floating islands. Joy acts as the leader and tries to limit Sadness's influence, perceiving her as an unnecessary burden for Riley. At age 11, Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco for her father's new job. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively saddens joyous memories, causing Riley to cry in front of her class. This creates Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of the memory using a pneumatic tube but knocks loose the other core memories during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters. In the absence of Joy and Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust try to make happy core memories, but the results are disastrous, distancing Riley from her parents, peers, and hobbies. Without the core memories, Anger causes Riley's personality islands to crumble and fall into the ""Memory Dump"", where things fade to non-existence as they are forgotten. While navigating the vast long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the ""train of thought"" back to Headquarters. Meanwhile, Anger, intending to restore Riley's happiness, convinces Disgust and Fear that Riley should run away to Minnesota, where her happy memories were formed. Joy, Sadness, and Bing Bong catch the train, but it is derailed when another island collapses. Joy, who is afraid all of the core memories will become sad, abandons Sadness and tries to ride a ""recall tube"" back to Headquarters. The ground below the tube collapses, sending Joy and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump. Joy discovers a sad memory of Riley losing a hockey game that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her, and she realizes Sadness's purpose in alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use his song-fueled wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to ascend due to their combined weight. In the final run, Bing Bong jumps out of the wagon, sacrificing himself to save Joy before fading away in the memory dump. Anger's idea shorts out the console, putting Riley into depression as she boards a bus to Minnesota. Joy reunites with Sadness, and they return to Headquarters. Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, much to the others' shock and confusion. Sadness successfully removes the idea bulb from the console, restarting it and prompting Riley to get off the bus and rush home. Joy, realizing that Riley needs to tell her parents the truth, hands Sadness the core memories, allowing her to make them sad. Riley bursts into tears, telling her parents she misses her old life. Riley's parents comfort her and tell her they also miss Minnesota. Sadness brings Joy over to have her join hands on the console, creating a new core memory that is both happy and sad, and a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her life in San Francisco. One year later, a 12-year old Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and acquired new hobbies. Inside Headquarters, Riley's emotions admire her new personality islands, powered by new multicolored core memories that contain a mixture of emotions, and are given an expanded console that has enough room for them to work as a team. Although they admit slight concern over a red alarm light marked puberty, they decide it isn't important at the moment.","Pete Docter , Ronnie Del Carmen","Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black"

On her first day at the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD), she is given parking duty by Chief Bogo and is hustled by red fox con artist Nick Wilde. The next day, she abandons her post to arrest small-time crook Duke Weaselton for stealing a bag of crocus bulbs. While Chief Bogo is reprimanding Judy, Mrs. Otterton visits his office, pleading for her husband Emmitt, one of 14 missing predators, to be found. Judy volunteers, and Bogo attempts to fire her for insubordination. When the city's assistant mayor, ewe Dawn Bellwether, praises Judy for taking the assignment, Bogo agrees but demands Judy's resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours. Having determined that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into helping her by recording his confession to tax evasion. They track a limousine that picked up Emmitt and learn that the vehicle is owned by Mr. Big, an arctic shrew crime boss whom Nick has a history with. Mr. Big explains that Emmitt unexpectedly ""went savage"" and attacked the limousine's chauffeur, Manchas, a black jaguar. Judy and Nick question Manchas, who explains that Emmitt yelled about ""Night Howlers"" before attacking him. Manchas suddenly turns savage himself and chases Judy and Nick. Judy traps Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but Manchas vanishes before backup arrives. At City Hall, Judy and Nick access Zootopia's traffic cameras, which reveal that Manchas was abducted by timberwolves, whom Judy assumes are the Night Howlers. Following the wolves, Judy and Nick locate Emmitt and the other missing predators, who are all ""savage"" and imprisoned in an asylum.

Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor. Judy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At a press conference, she accidentally implies the savageness epidemic was caused by the physiology that all predators possess. Disappointed and offended, Nick abandons Judy, whose comments incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt, she quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow. While managing her parents' vegetable stand, Judy learns that Night Howlers are actually Midnicampum flowers, which have severe, lasting psychotropic effects if ingested. Realizing that someone is using the flowers to turn predators savage, she returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Nick. Aided by Mr. Big, they interrogate Weaselton, who admits that a ram named Doug hired him to steal the Night Howler bulbs. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the subway, where he manufactures a serum from the Night Howlers to use against predators via a tranquilizer dart. Judy and Nick obtain a serum gun as evidence after a chase in the subway but, before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and reveals herself to be the mastermind of a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Judy and Nick become trapped in an exhibit; Bellwether shoots Nick with the serum gun and orders the ZPD to capture him, but Judy and Nick have already replaced the darts with blueberries and recorded Bellwether's confession. Bellwether and her accomplices are arrested, while Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of her scheme, insisting that imprisoning the infected predators was ""doing the wrong thing for the right reason"". The predators are rehabilitated, and Judy is reinstated into the ZPD.

They are driven into isolation after firing a cannon at Napoleon while in Russia and start a new life inside a cave, but after many years, the Minions become sad and unmotivated without a boss to serve.

At the convention, they meet Scarlet Overkill, the world's first female supervillain, who unexpectedly hires them and takes them to her home in London. They phone the rest of the Minions to get them to join. Scarlet plans to steal the Imperial State Crown from Queen Elizabeth II, promising to reward the Minions if they succeed, but also threatening to kill them if they fail. Scarlet's husband Herb supplies them with inventions to aid in the heist, but they are nearly caught while breaking into the Tower of London.

Carl befriends Ellie, another young Muntz fan, who keeps a scrapbook of her adventures and dreams of moving her ""clubhouse"" (an abandoned house) to Paradise Falls and having adventures of her own. Carl and Ellie eventually marry, renovate the clubhouse and move in. They work at the city zoo as a balloon salesman and zookeeper, respectively.

28,Monster University,2013,"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","As a child, Mike Wazowski visits the Monsters Inc. factory on a class field trip to learn about how ""scarers"" harness human children's screams for energy to power the monster world. He secretly follows a scarer through a door to the human world to watch him work; the scarer is surprised with Mike's dangerous actions, yet impressed with his stealth and gives him his Monsters University (MU) cap. Years later, Mike enrolls in the scaring program at MU and is assigned Randall ""Randy"" Boggs as a roommate. On the first day of class, Abigail Hardscrabble, the dean of the scaring program and president of MU, warns that students who fail the first semester's final exam will leave the scaring program. Mike then encounters James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan, the son of a famous scarer. Sulley gets into the top fraternity on campus, R?R (Roar Omega Roar), which rejects Mike for not looking scary enough. Over the next few months, Mike works and studies hard to improve himself while Sulley slacks off, relying on his family name and natural talent. An intense rivalry forms between Mike and Sulley throughout the semester, seeing each other as the antithesis of their views on success. On exam day, the duo's rivalry gets out of control when they inadvertently destroy Hardscrabble's prized scream canister. She personally tests and fails them both; Sulley for a lack of technical knowledge and rushing and Mike for not being physically ""scary"" as the former is promptly kicked out of R?R. Next semester, both Sulley and Mike switch majors from scaring to scream can design. Sulley was grumpy at Mike whilst Mike felt hopeless and upset that he cannot continue in the scaring program due to his appearance. Determined to prove his worth, Mike enters the annual Scare Games with OK (Oozma Kappa), a small fraternity of misfits, as his team, and makes a deal with Hardscrabble: if OK wins, they and Mike will return to the scare program, or else Mike will have to leave MU. Short one team member for full entry into the games, Sulley volunteers. With Randy joining R?R's team and thus ending his friendship with Mike, he begrudgingly accepts Sulley. Initially, OK places last in the first round but are saved from elimination when another team is disqualified for cheating, and barely pass the second round. The R?Rs invite OK to a mid-game party, then stage a humiliating prank on them and post pictures of it all over campus. The team becomes discouraged, so Mike takes them to Monsters Inc., where they sneak in and watch the scarers using their differences as advantages. After being chased off by security, the rejuvenated team begins to work together under Mike's coaching and passes the next two challenges right behind R?R. In the final challenge, OK and R?R face off in a simulator in 1v1 matches, each trying to frighten a dummy child. OK wins after Mike racks up a maximum score with his scare. However, Mike later discovers that Sulley had rigged the simulator's settings for Mike's turn to guarantee a win, leading to a falling out between the duo. The rest of OK discard the trophy in disappointment as Sulley, ashamed of what he had done, admits his guilt to Hardscrabble. Outraged at Sulley's betrayal, deciding that no one could be trusted to allow him a fair chance, and still determined to prove he is scary, Mike sneaks through an experimental door to the human world into a summer camp cabin full of children, only to find that none of them are afraid of him. Feeling responsible for Mike's predicament, Sulley sneaks past security and Hardscrabble to go after Mike. Sulley admits to Mike his own fears and they make amends just as Hardscrabble deactivates the door to keep the other monsters safe.[c] The duo collaborate to scare the rangers, creating enough energy to power the door from their side, and they escape just as it explodes. Sulley and Mike are expelled from MU as punishment for their actions, but the other OK members are invited into the scaring program. As Mike and Sulley leave, Hardscrabble admits they surprised her and changed her outlook on a monster's potential as scarers, and expresses her hope that they can continue to surprise others moving forward. The duo go to work for Monsters Inc. in the mailroom and over the years work their way up through the ranks in the company until Sulley becomes a scarer, with Mike as his coach/scare assistant.",Dan Scanlon,"Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi"

Bob rejects Buddy, and Voyage clips a bomb onto Buddy's cape. Bob gets the bomb off, but it destroys an elevated train track, forcing Bob to stop an oncoming train. After his wedding, Bob is sued for collateral damage by the suicidal civilian and the injured train passengers.

One day, Maui, the shape-shifting demigod of the wind and sea and master of wayfinding, stole Te Fiti's heart to give humanity the power of creation. This caused Te Fiti to disintegrate, and Maui was attacked by Te K?, a volcanic demon. Maui lost both the heart and his magic fish hook to the depths of the sea. A thousand years later, the ocean chooses Moana, the daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui and Sina, Moana's parents, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her to become the island's chief. Sixteen years later, blight strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef with her pet pig, Pua, to find more fish and discover what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef, but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked. That afternoon, Moana's grandmother Tala shows her a secret cavern of ships and reveals Motunui's people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains Te K?'s darkness is destroying the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and has him restore the heart of Te Fiti. Having been given the heart by the ocean, Tala gives it to Moana. Tala later becomes gravely ill and tells Moana to find Maui. Moana sets sail on a camakau from the cavern along with her dimwitted pet rooster, Heihei, who stowed away on it. They are caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island, where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave before leaving on her boat. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora, coconut pirates who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. However, Maui first needs to retrieve his fishhook in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant coconut crab. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook, only to find himself unable to control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals his first tattoo was earned when his human parents abandoned him as an infant, and the gods, taking pity on him, granted him his powers. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of way-finding, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer. They arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K?. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook again, Maui abandons Moana, who loses hope and tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. Moana retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K?. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K?, destroying his hook in the process. Upon being unable to find Te Fiti, Moana realizes Te K? is Te Fiti, but corrupted without her heart. The ocean clears a path for Moana, allowing her to return the heart to Te Fiti, who heals the ocean and islands of blight.

He announces that he has to return home to Andy, dismaying the gang, because the museum will not accept the collection without Woody. And without him, the rest of the gang will go back into storage. After Woody's arm is repaired the next day, Woody learns that Jessie was abandoned by her owner, Emily, when she grew up. Convinced that Andy might do the same to him, Woody decides to go to the museum. Meanwhile, Buzz's group reaches Al's Toy Barn and searches for Woody. Buzz encounters a Utility Belt Buzz toy; assuming he is a real space ranger going AWOL, Utility Belt Buzz imprisons Andy's Buzz. Utility Belt Buzz later meets Andy's other toys and, assuming they are on a mission to defeat his arch-nemesis, Emperor Zurg, accompanies them to Al's apartment. Andy's Buzz escapes and follows the gang, inadvertently releasing a toy Zurg who follows Buzz to destroy him. Both Buzzes and the rest of the search party arrive at the apartment, but Woody initially refuses to go home with them. Shortly after the search party leaves, Woody reconsiders and invites the Woody's Roundup toys to join him and become Andy's toys. While a hesitant Jessie and an enthusiastic Bullseye accept Woody's offer, Pete refuses and blocks the others from leaving; having never been played with, he is adamant about going to the museum. Al returns to the apartment and takes the Woody's Roundup collection to the airport. While Utility Belt Buzz plays ball with Zurg, Andy's Buzz and the other toys pursue Al's suitcase into the airport. After a prolonged pursuit through the airport's baggage sorting system during which Pete re-opens the tear in Woody's arm the other toys subdue Pete and place him in a girl's backpack; she takes Pete with her. They save Bullseye, but Jessie is loaded onto the plane. Woody, Buzz, and Bullseye work together to save her just as the plane takes off. The toys then return home to Andy's house. Andy returns from Cowboy Camp that night, plays with Jessie and Bullseye, and repairs Woody and Wheezy the following morning. Al mourns the loss of the lucrative deal with the toy museum on television. Woody tells Buzz that he no longer fears Andy losing interest in him.","John Lasseter, Ash Brannon, Lee Unkrich","Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack"
36,Cars,2006,"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","In a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles, the Dinoco 400 race is the last of the Piston Cup stock car racing season. The event is highlighted by a rivalry between three racers - retiring seven-time champion, Strip ""The King"" Weathers; pompous perpetual runner-up Chick Hicks who has resorted to intentional ramming to get ahead; and talented but egocentric rookie, Lightning McQueen - who are all tied for the most points. Desperate to win and leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-eze for the King's prestigious Dinoco one, Lightning struggles with teamwork and races without a crew chief. During the race, Lightning refuses to take new tires, causing his rear tires to blow out before he can win. The race ends in a three-way tie between the leaders, setting the stage for a decisive race at the Los Angeles International Speedway in one week. Lightning s crew also quits, fed up with him. After the race, goaded by Chick into racing to Los Angeles, Lightning forces his transport truck Mack to drive cross-country on the interstate without stopping, eventually tiring Mack out. This precipitates a mishap that leaves Lightning stranded alone in the rundown desert town of Radiator Springs, Arizona. Panicking, he inadvertently carves a ditch in the main road and is arrested. Although the town s judge Doc Hudson tries to expel him, local attorney and motel owner Sally Carrera sways public opinion, and eventually Doc s hand, to have Lightning sentenced to a community service assignment of repaving the road under the supervision of rusty tow truck Mater. In a rush to leave, Lightning shoddily repaves the road, so Doc challenges him to a race for his freedom, on the condition that he starts over from scratch if he loses. The overconfident Lightning, having never raced on a dirt road before, spins out on a turn and crashes into a cactus patch, with Doc having set up the race accordingly. Over time, Lightning warms up to and befriends the town's residents, especially Mater and Sally, who become his best friend and mutual love interest respectively. While on a date, Sally informs Lightning that the town was once a bustling rest area attraction for drivers on Route 66, before the construction of Interstate 40 caused them to lose all their business traffic. Lightning also discovers that Doc won three Piston Cups as the legendary Hudson Hornet until a disastrous crash ended his career; he has hidden his past from the other townsfolk and now has resentment towards everything racing-related, which Lightning deems selfish. Lightning finishes repairing the road but decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs helping the local businesses and fixing their lighting system. However, Doc alerts the media to Lightning's location, leading them and Mack to descend on the town and force Lightning to leave in time for the race. Doc regrets his actions after seeing the residents despondent by his departure. At the race, the distracted Lightning initially struggles, but is buoyed by the arrival of his friends from Radiator Springs, who come to his aid in the pit. With Doc now acting as his crew chief, Lightning stages a remarkable comeback. However, Chick employs a PIT maneuver that intentionally damages the King, rendering him unable to continue. Reminded of Doc's crash, Lightning halts just before the finish line, allowing Chick to win, and pushes the King across, allowing him to finish his last race. The crowd and media condemn Chick's victory and praise Lightning's integrity and sportsmanship. Lightning is offered the Dinoco sponsorship, but declines out of newfound loyalty to Rust-eze. Returning to Radiator Springs, he reunites with Sally and declares his intention to establish his racing headquarters there, revitalizing the town.","John Lasseter, Joe Ranft","Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman"

Despite their deal with Fairy Godmother, they go to Rumpelstiltskin for help. He has a magical contract that will seemingly lift the curse if they give him the Kingdom of Far Far Away, but when Harold is about to sign it, a messenger reveals that Fiona has been rescued by Shrek. Ever since, Rumpel has held a grudge against Shrek for ruining his plan. In the present, Shrek has grown tired of being a family man and a celebrity, longing for the days when he was feared and had privacy. While he is celebrating his children's first birthday in Far Far Away, a series of mishaps leaves Shrek so angry that he storms out in a rage and lashes out at Fiona. Having witnessed the outburst, Rumpel follows Shrek into the forest and stages a scene of being in distress, prompting Shrek to help. Invited inside Rumpel's carriage, Shrek laments that he is no longer a ""real ogre"". Rumpel offers him a deal to receive a day as a ""real ogre"" in exchange for a day from his childhood. Shrek signs a contract fulfilling this wish, and is whisked away into an alternate reality. Now feared by villagers, Shrek causes some mischief until he discovers that Fiona is a fugitive and his swamp is deserted and desolate. Captured by witches, Shrek is taken to Rumpel, who is now the king of Far Far Away. Rumpel reveals to Shrek that he tricked Shrek into giving him the day he was born, meaning Shrek never existed in this altered timeline. Consequently, Harold and Lillian signed the contract with Rumpel, which caused them to disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will cease to exist. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey, who is initially terrified of Shrek but befriends him after seeing him cry over his erased history. Donkey helps Shrek find a hidden exit clause; the contract can be nullified by ""true love's kiss"". The pair soon encounter a still-cursed Fiona leading an army of ogres in a resistance against Rumpel, and a lazy and overweight Puss in Boots being kept as Fiona's pet. Shrek unsuccessfully tries to woo Fiona, who has since lost hope of finding true love after not being rescued, and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. Puss encourages Shrek to continue pursuing Fiona. During the ambush, most of the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper, who was hired by Rumpel, but Shrek and Fiona escape with Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists that Fiona kiss him, assuring her that it will fix everything; she reluctantly obliges, but nothing happens. Later on, Rumpel publicly offers a wish to anyone who brings him Shrek, and after hearing this, Shrek turns himself in. Rumpel is forced to grant Shrek's wish, and he uses it to free the other ogres. As Shrek is locked up, Rumpel reveals that Fiona had been captured and not released, since she is not ""all ogre"". Donkey, Puss, and the freed ogres storm the castle; they capture Rumpel and defeat his witch army, while Shrek and Fiona take down Dragon. As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses him before he disappears. Seeing that she is still an ogre in the sunlight, Fiona realizes that her curse was broken and that she has assumed ""love's true form"". The alternate reality disintegrates, making everyone disappear, and Shrek finds himself transported back to the original timeline at the moment before he lost his temper at the party. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces his family and friends with a newfound appreciation for them. Later, Shrek hosts a party in his swamp with his friends, family, and the other ogres, with an imprisoned Rumpel in attendance.",Mike Mitchell,"Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy"

In the forest, Merida encounters a will-o'-the-wisp and follows the other wisps to her family and Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs Fergus one of his legs. Ten years later, Merida discovers she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch; Elinor reminds Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom. The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the Highland games for Merida's hand in marriage. Twisting the rules, Merida announces that, as her own clan's firstborn, she will compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors and, after arguing with Elinor, runs away into the forest. She encounters the wisps again, who lead her to the hut of an elderly witch, where she bargains for a spell to ""change"" Elinor. The witch gives her an enchanted cake. Elinor eats the cake and is transformed into a bear, unable to speak but retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the deserted witch's cottage, and discovers a message from the witch: she must ""mend the bond, torn by pride"" by the second sunrise, or the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor encounter Mor'du and realize Mor'du was the prince in the legend. Merida vows not to let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she deliberately damaged during their argument. They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but at Elinor's prompting, she instead allows the firstborns to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing their alliance. Losing her humanity, Elinor attacks Fergus and flees the castle.

Merida thwarts them before the real Mor'du arrives. Mor'du targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, causing Mor'du to be crushed by a falling menhir. This releases the spirit of the prince, who thanks Merida for freeing him and transforms into a wisp. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida covers Elinor in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. Thinking it was for nothing, Merida reconciles with her mother begging to have her back, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message. This reverses the spell's effects on her mother and brothers. With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry, bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses together.","Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman, Steve Purcell","Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson"
39,WALL-E,2008,"Animation, Adventure, Family","In the 29th century, Earth is a garbage-strewn wasteland due to an ecocide caused by rampant consumerism, corporate greed, and environmental neglect. Humanity was evacuated to space by the megacorporation Buy n Large (BnL) on giant spaceships 700 years earlier, leaving trash-compacting robots to clean up the planet. All but one of the robots have stopped functioning; the last remaining active robot, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-class), has developed a personality. WALL-E remains active by salvaging parts from inactive robots, with his pet cockroach Hal as his only companion. One day, WALL-E's routine of compressing trash and collecting interesting objects is broken by the arrival of a robot called EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), which scans the planet for sustainable life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, futuristic robot, and the two begin to connect, until EVE goes into standby mode when WALL-E shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. EVE is collected by a large unmanned rocket; with WALL-E clinging on, it returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom. In the centuries since the Axiom left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless obesity due to microgravity and laziness, with robots catering to their every whim. Captain B. McCrea sits back while his robotic AI autopilot helm, nicknamed AUTO, pilots the ship. McCrea is unprepared for the positive probe response, but discovers that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so that humanity can begin recolonization. When McCrea inspects EVE's storage compartment, the plant is missing, and EVE blames WALL-E for its disappearance. EVE is deemed faulty and taken to diagnostics. WALL-E intervenes and inadvertently releases the other faulty bots, causing him and EVE to be designated rogue robots. EVE tries sending WALL-E home in an escape pod, but the two witness McCrea's first mate robot, GO-4, stowing the plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E enters the pod to retrieve the plant just as it launches, and he and the plant survive the pod's destruction. EVE catches up to him and they reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the Axiom. EVE brings the plant to McCrea, who watches her recordings of Earth, concluding that they must save it. AUTO reveals that secret no-return directive A113 orders them to not return to Earth, on account of toxicity levels making Earth unlivable. When McCrea tries overriding the directive, AUTO electrocutes WALL-E, throws WALL-E and EVE down a garbage chute, and confines McCrea to his quarters. EVE and WALL-E are nearly ejected into space with the Axiom's garbage, but cleaning robot Microbe Obliterator (M-O) inadvertently jams the airlock and rescues them. As humans and robots help to secure the plant, McCrea and AUTO fight for control of the Axiom. AUTO crushes WALL-E using the Holo-Detector, but McCrea overpowers and deactivates AUTO. EVE inserts the plant into the Holo-Detector, initiating the hyperjump back to Earth. Arriving on Earth, EVE repairs WALL-E, but his memory and personality have been erased. EVE gives WALL-E a goodbye ""kiss"", which releases a static electricity shock, restoring him. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the Axiom inhabitants take their first steps on Earth. Humans and robots work to restore the ravaged planet, and the plant grows into a tree, beneath which WALL-E and EVE rest.",Andrew Stanton,"Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin"

The circus is headed for a show in Rome, followed by one in London, where they hope to impress a promoter to get their first American tour. To allay suspicion, the penguins purchase the circus from its human ringmaster with the fortune they gained in Monte Carlo.  In Rome, Alex becomes enamored with Gia while Julien falls in love with performing Eurasian brown bear Sonya. DuBois attempts to pursue the couple in Vatican City, but fails to catch them and is taken into custody. After the Colosseum show proves to be a disaster, Stefano reveals to Alex that the circus was once famous and Vitaly was its star, skillfully jumping through ever-smaller hoops. However, an accident during one of his stunts resulted in him losing his passion, and the entire circus suffered as a result.  When the train stops at the Alps, Alex convinces the circus animals to devise a new and exciting all-animal act that will restore their former glory. Marty and Stefano find a new passion in being shot out of a cannon, while Melman and Gloria become adept at dancing together on a tightrope. Gia persuades Alex to teach her ""Trapeze Americano"" and soon romance flourishes between the duo. Meanwhile, DuBois resumes her hunt after escaping from prison.  In London, Vitaly is afraid of failing again and considers ditching the show, but Alex helps him rediscover his passion by successfully assisting him in the opening act. The show succeeds, and the promoter signs a contract with the circus. DuBois then shows up, and although the penguins foil her, a printed document detailing Alex that she was carrying exposes his group's true intentions. Feeling deceived and betrayed, the circus animals eject the quartet.  After Sonya ends her relationship with Julien, the zoo and circus animals go their separate ways but arrive in Central Park simultaneously. Looking at their old home, the zoo animals realize how much their worldwide adventure has changed them and decide their true place is with the circus. They are then ambushed by DuBois, but before she can behead Alex, the zoo staff arrive and incorrectly believe that she is returning the missing animals. Julien returns to the circus with the news as he reconciles with Sonya before the circus staff settles on rescuing their friends.  Alex's group awakens in their old enclosures, now surrounded by high fencing. DuBois is being honored by the zoo staff, but she rejects their offered reward money and secretly attempts to kill Alex with a poison-filled dart. The circus staff soon saves them, and together, the heroes defeat DuBois as Alex's group joins the circus. As retribution, the penguins ship DuBois to Madagascar.

One day, Master Oogway, the founder of kung fu and the Valley's spiritual leader, predicts Shifu's former apprentice, the snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape and attack the Valley for the Dragon Scroll, an artifact granting limitless power that he was denied. In response, Shifu sends his assistant Zeng to strengthen security at Chorh-Gom Prison, where Tai Lung is held.  Shifu holds a tournament to identify the Dragon Warrior, the prophesied hero worthy of reading the Scroll, which Po arrives late to. Eager to see his idols, he tries various ways to enter the arena. Using a chair propelled by fireworks, Po unintentionally lands in front of the Five during the tournament as Oogway unexpectedly declares him the Dragon Warrior. Shifu believes Oogway's choice is an accident, and the Five dismiss Po after a rough first day of training, leaving him dejected and considering quitting. However, Oogway encourages him to persevere through Shifu's challenging training, and Po gradually befriends the Five with his resilience and humor. Tigress reveals that Shifu's toughness comes from his shame over Tai Lung's betrayal and having raised him as an infant.  At the prison, Tai Lung uses one of Zeng's feathers to escape, eliminating the guards and sending Zeng back. Learning the bad news from Zeng, Shifu warns Oogway, who makes Shifu promise to believe in Po as the Dragon Warrior and names him his successor before ascending to the Spirit Realm.

When asked why he stayed, Po admits he disliked his former self but believed Shifu could change him. Po then makes Shifu confess that he does not know how to train him as the Dragon Warrior. Tigress overhears and leads the Five in a secret attempt to stop Tai Lung themselves.  Meanwhile, Shifu realizes Po's full potential for physical feats when food motivates him, so he trains Po in a unique kung fu style. The Five confront Tai Lung, who defeats them with his nerve-strike technique, leaving only Crane to return the Five as a warning. Shifu decides Po is ready for the Dragon Scroll, but Po discovers it is blank. Thinking the Scroll is powerless, Shifu sends Po and the Five to evacuate the Valley while he faces Tai Lung alone. To comfort a distraught Po, Mr. Ping reveals his ""secret ingredient soup"" has no secret ingredient at all, stating that belief can make things special. Understanding this is the Dragon Scroll's message, Po rushes back to help Shifu.  At the Jade Palace, Tai Lung brutally defeats Shifu, only to find the Scroll is missing. Po arrives with the Scroll and engages Tai Lung in combat with confusing techniques to gain an advantage. Tai Lung gets the Scroll but cannot understand its blank surface. Enraged, he uses a nerve-strike on Po, who remains unaffected due to his body fat. Po overpowers Tai Lung and banishes him to the Spirit Realm with the Wuxi Finger Hold technique, which he taught himself. Honored as a hero by the residents and the Five for saving the Valley, Po relaxes with a recovered Shifu before they decide to go eat."," Mark Osborne, John Stevenson"," Jack Black, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie"

When he never returns, Imelda bans music from her family and opens a shoemaking business.  Decades later, Imelda's great-great-grandson Miguel lives in the family home with his parents and relatives, including an elderly and ailing Coco. Despite the family's continued ban on music, Miguel secretly loves it and teaches himself to play guitar by watching videos of his idol, the late musician Ernesto de la Cruz. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel inadvertently bumps the family ofrenda and breaks a frame containing a photo of Imelda and an infant Coco. He discovers a hidden section of the photograph that shows his great-great-grandfather (whose head has been torn from the photo) holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Believing this proves Ernesto is his relative, Miguel excitedly tells his family about his musical aspirations. In response, Miguel's grandmother destroys his guitar, causing him to shun his family.  Distraught, Miguel breaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar to use in a local talent competition. Once Miguel strums it, he becomes invisible to all living people. However, he can interact with his skeletal dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they realize Imelda cannot visit since Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Miguel also discovers that he has been cursed for stealing from the dead: he must receive a family blessing to return to the living world before sunrise or he will remain in the Land of the Dead forever. Imelda offers him a blessing on the condition that he abandons music, but Miguel refuses and seeks Ernesto's blessing instead.  Miguel encounters H ctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once performed with Ernesto. H ctor offers to bring Miguel to Ernesto in exchange for Miguel placing his photo on an ofrenda so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him, which would cause him to fade from existence. H ctor helps Miguel perform in a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel flees after being discovered by his family.  Miguel sneaks into Ernesto's mansion and is welcomed by a surprised Ernesto, but H ctor appears and accuses Ernesto of stealing his songs. As the two argue, Miguel slowly pieces together the truth: Ernesto and H ctor were once a musical act on the brink of fame until H ctor grew homesick and tried to leave. Unable to write songs himself, Ernesto poisoned H ctor and stole his guitar and songs to pass off as his own. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes H ctor's photo and has Miguel and H ctor thrown into a cenote pit. There, H ctor reveals that his daughter is named Coco, thus making him Miguel s actual great-great-grandfather.  After being rescued by his family, Miguel reveals the truth about H ctor's death, and Imelda and H ctor reconcile. The family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who quickly turn on him, and he is crushed by a falling bell (mirroring his fate in real life), although H ctor's photograph is lost in the chaos. As the sun rises, Imelda and a fading H ctor bless Miguel and return him to the living world.  Back home, Miguel apologizes to his family for running away and plays ""Remember Me"" on H ctor's guitar, brightening Coco to sing with him. She shares that she kept the torn piece of the photo with H ctor's face, then tells her family stories about her father, preserving his memory and existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel reconciles with his family and their ban on music is finally lifted.  One year later, Miguel shows his new baby sister the family ofrenda, now displaying photos of H ctor and a recently deceased Coco, while Coco's collected letters from H ctor prove Ernesto's theft of his songs, leading to Ernesto's disgrace and H ctor's rightful recognition. In the Land of the Dead, H ctor joins Imelda, Coco, and their family to visit the living world.

49,Ratatouille ,2007,"Satire, comedy, family, fantasy, Animation","Remy, a young rat with heightened senses of taste and smell, dreams of becoming a chef like his human idol, the late Auguste Gusteau. Conversely, the rest of his colony, including his older brother  mile and his father, Django, the clan leader, only eat for sustenance and are wary of humans. The rats live in an elderly woman's attic outside Paris, but when the woman discovers them, they are forced to evacuate, and Remy is separated. Encouraged by an imaginary Gusteau, he explores until he finds himself on the roof of Gusteau's namesake restaurant.  Remy sees the restaurant's new garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, struggling to fix a soup he ruined and steps in to help. Linguini notices Remy but keeps his presence secret from Skinner, Gusteau's former sous-chef and new owner. When Skinner confronts Linguini about the soup, it unexpectedly becomes a hit. Colette Tatou, the restaurant's only female chef, persuades Skinner to keep Linguini and support Gusteau's motto, ""Anyone can cook"". Skinner demands Linguini replicate the soup but spots Remy, ordering Linguini to take him outside and kill him. Alone, Linguini realizes Remy understands him and persuades Remy to assist with cooking.  Remy controls Linguini's movements like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hiding under his toque. They re-create the soup and continue cooking at the restaurant. Colette begrudgingly trains Linguini but steadily appreciates him heeding her advice. Later, Remy finds  mile and reunites with the clan. After Remy tells Django that he intends to stay at the restaurant, Django shows him a group of exterminated rats to convince him that humans are dangerous, but Remy ignores his warnings and leaves.  Meanwhile, Skinner discovers through a letter from Linguini's late mother that Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate son and thereby the rightful owner of the restaurant. Skinner is shocked and enraged about this revelation, as Gusteau's will stated that he would inherit ownership of the restaurant only if no next of kin appeared two years after the latter's death. After his lawyer verifies that Linguini is Gusteau's heir, Skinner hides the evidence in an envelope. Remy escapes with this, and shows it to Linguini, who then fires Skinner and discontinues a line of frozen food that Skinner had started. The restaurant thrives as Remy's recipes become popular, and Linguini's life improves as he develops a romantic relationship with Colette. Food critic Anton Ego, whose previous negative review of the restaurant indirectly led to Gusteau's death, announces to Linguini that he will review the restaurant again the following day. After Linguini takes credit for Remy's cooking at a press conference, he and Remy have a falling out. As revenge, Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant's pantries. Linguini arrives to apologize, but upon discovering the raid, he furiously expels Remy and his clan from the restaurant.  The next day, Skinner captures Remy, who is quickly freed by Django and  mile. After returning to the restaurant, he and Linguini reconcile, and Linguini reveals Remy and his cooking techniques to his staff, who all immediately quit. Reminded of Gusteau's motto, Colette returns to help the clan cook under Remy's direction while Linguini waits tables. Skinner and a health inspector attempt to interfere, but the rats lock them in the pantry. Remy creates a variation of ratatouille, which reminds Ego of his mother's cooking. Delighted, Ego asks to meet the chef and is stunned when introduced to Remy. The next day, he writes a review, stating that he has come to understand Gusteau's motto and describing Remy without revealing that he is a rat.  Remy's narration had him stating that Skinner and the health inspector were let out and Gusteau's is shut down, stripping Ego of his job and credibility. Remy, Linguini, and Colette open a bistro called La Ratatouille, which a now-happier Ego invests in and frequents.

Ralph is content with their life, but Vanellope longs for excitement and expresses how bored she has become of Sugar Rush's predictability. To please her, Ralph sneaks into her game and makes a secret road. The next day, when Vanellope fights the arcade player's control to test the track, the cabinet's steering wheel breaks. As the company that made Sugar Rush is defunct, and the cost of a replacement wheel on eBay is too high, Litwak decides to scrap Sugar Rush and unplugs the game, leaving its citizens homeless. The Surge Protector finds homes for all Sugar Rush's citizens as a short-term measure as they figure out how to save the game, with Felix and Calhoun adopting the racers. Remembering eBay, Ralph and Vanellope travel through Litwak's new Wi-Fi router to the Internet, a place where websites are represented as buildings in a sprawling city, avatars represent users, and programs are people.  The search engine KnowsMore redirects them to eBay, where they win the auction for the steering wheel by unintentionally spiking the price to US$27,001 only to find they have just 24 hours to raise the funds, or they will lose the bid and the wheel. On the way out, they run into clickbait salesman J. P. Spamley, who brokers items obtained from video games and offers them a lucrative job of stealing a car from Shank, the lead character in the popular racing-centered battle royale game Slaughter Race. They steal Shank's car, but she stops them before they can leave the game with it. Suggesting another way to make money on the Internet, she proceeds to make a viral video of Ralph and uploads it to video-sharing site BuzzzTube. She directs them to BuzzzTube's head algorithm, Yesss, who capitalizes on Ralph's video popularity. They decide to make more videos, which will earn them the money for the wheel if they attract enough views. Vanellope offers to help advertise the videos, and Ralph has Yesss send her to Oh My Disney. There, while being chased by Stormtroopers for unauthorized advertising, Vanellope befriends the Disney Princesses, being encouraged by them to discuss her sense of un-fulfillment and reaching an epiphany in the form of an ""I Want"" song on the subject. Ralph makes enough money to buy the wheel but finds Vanellope talking with Shank, overhearing how she wants to stay in Slaughter Race, having felt at home there due to its relative novelty and unpredictability compared to Sugar Rush.  Worried about losing his friend forever, Ralph asks Spamley for a way to draw Vanellope out of the game and is brought to the dark web vendor Double Dan, who provides Ralph with a virus, Arthur, that feeds off insecurities and replicates them. When Ralph unleashes Arthur into Slaughter Race, it replicates Vanellope's glitch, triggering a server reboot. Ralph, Shank, and the others help Vanellope escape before the game resets. Vanellope blames herself for the crash, but Ralph confesses to her that it was actually his fault. This revelation causes an outraged Vanellope to throw away Ralph's cookie medal and run off.  A guilt-ridden Ralph finds his now-cracked-in-half medal. In lieu of cyber-insecurities, Arthur copies Ralph's emotional insecurities, and makes dim-witted and emotionally unstable duplicates of Ralph. The clones overrun the Internet in a global DoS attack, all chasing after Vanellope to keep her for themselves. Ralph saves her and attempts to lure the clones into a firewall, but they form a giant Ralph monster that seizes them both. Ralph comes to accept that Vanellope can make her own choices, letting go of his insecurities and causing the clones to disappear, and Ralph and Vanellope reconcile. Ralph gives half of the broken medal to Vanellope and they bid each other a heartfelt farewell as Shank has arranged for Vanellope to respawn in Slaughter Race.  Back in the arcade, Sugar Rush is repaired, and Ralph joins the other arcade characters' activities as he stays in touch with Vanellope over video chat, feeling content with his newfound ability to be independent.","Phil Johnston, Rich Moore"," John C.

Nearing lava falls, Ellie enters labor, and a pack of Guanlong causes a rock slide that separates her from the rest. Buck commands Manny and Diego to stay behind to protect Ellie while he and the possums rescue Sid. Diego regains his edge from defeating the Guanlong while supporting Ellie emotionally as she gives birth. Manny slows down the rest as he makes his way up to her. Buck, Crash, and Eddie ride a Harpactognathus to Lava Falls, but a pack of Quetzalcoatlus follow, preying on the possums and forcing them to detour through a canyon. They defeat the Quetzalcoatlus, and return to Lava Falls just in time to rescue Sid. Back at the plates, the remaining Guanlong are defeated with Manny reaching Ellie just in time to see his newborn daughter, agreeing to name the baby ""Peaches"". Sid is happy to reunite with his friends, but is sad that he never had a chance to say goodbye to the Tyrannosaurus.  Before leaving the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy, but the herd is eventually saved by the mother Tyrannosaurus, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff. Sid then says goodbye to the dinosaurs, and Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join the herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive. Changing his mind, he sends the herd home and blocks off the path to the lost world. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world, and Diego decides to remain with the herd, while Buck stays underground, trying to tame Rudy.  Meanwhile, Scrat and Scratte, having continued their fight into the dinosaur world, fall in love and decide to live in the jungle together. Still, Scratte suddenly becomes bossy, making Scrat choose the acorn over her. Scratte catches him and takes away the acorn, causing a fight. Scrat is accidentally launched back to the surface, while the acorn and Scratte are trapped in the dinosaur world.","Carlos Saldanha, Michael Thurmeier","Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary"
55,Ice Age: The Meltdown,2006,"Adventure, Comedy, Family, Animation","Manny, Sid, and Diego live in a valley that is surrounded by a high ice wall on all sides and is inhabited by many other creatures. The trio discovers that the ice wall is actually a dam that is barely holding a reservoir that could flood the valley if it fails. A vulture tells them that there is a boat at the other end of the valley that may save them, but they must reach it in three days. A chunk of ice breaks off from the top of the dam, initiating their immediate evacuation. Manny is also struggling with the thought of possibly being the last mammoth alive.  Meanwhile, Cretaceous, an ichthyosaur and Maelstrom, a pliosaur both frozen since the Mesozoic era escape due to melting ice and seek to eat all the mammals they can during the flood. On their journey to the boat, the trio meet Ellie, a mammoth who believes she is an opossum, and Crash and Eddie, two mischievous opossums whom Ellie believes to be her brothers. Sid invites them to join their journey to the boat, and Ellie accepts. After a dangerous encounter with Cretaceous and Maelstrom while crossing a pond, Ellie realizes that she is a mammoth. Manny begins to fall in love with her, but denies his feelings at first because he feels like he is replacing his deceased wife and child. Despite this bonding moment with Manny, she distances herself from him when he suggests ""saving their species"". Ellie and Manny later reconcile.  The herd takes a break for the night. The next day, the group finds the boat behind a field of hot geysers. Manny, Sid, and Diego separate from Ellie, Crash, and Eddie when the two mammoths argue about which route is safest.  Just as Manny, Sid, and Diego bypass the geysers, the ice dam fails, unleashing a flood upon the valley. Ellie, Crash, and Eddie, who took the safer yet longer way, are trapped inside a cave due to falling rocks. Crash and Eddie escape through a small hole and warn Manny, who rushes back to save Ellie. Cretaceous and Maelstorm ambush Manny underwater, but he tricks them into dislodging a boulder, thus freeing Ellie. Manny and Ellie reunite with the others atop a boulder, but the water is still rising. Meanwhile, Scrat, after a series of misadventures to get back his acorn, climbs the adjacent glacial wall beside them and inadvertently creates a long crack when he punctures the ice. The crack widens into a gigantic fissure which splits open the wall and drains the floodwaters, saving everyone; in the process, Scrat falls within the fissure and is washed away.  A group of mammoths later appear from the fissure, proving to everyone that mammoths are not really extinct. Manny initially lets Ellie go with the mammoth herd, but after some encouragement from Sid and Diego to move on from his past, he catches up to her, expressing his desire to stay with her. Manny, Sid, Diego, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie then venture out of the valley.  After falling into the fissure and nearly drowning, Scrat has a near death experience, entering a heaven full of acorns. Suddenly, he finds himself being ""sucked back"" just as he is about to reach a gigantic acorn. Scrat then discovers that he has been resuscitated by Sid. Scrat is enraged, believing that Sid stole his acorn, and proceeds to viciously attack him.",Carlos Saldanha,"Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary"

Under pressure from anti-captivity activists, the zoo is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a nature reserve in Kenya. During the trip, the penguins escape their crate and hijack the ship, hoping to head to Antarctica, causing the crates containing Alex and his friends to fall overboard.  Upon being washed ashore on Madagascar, the animals come across its lemur community. The predatory fossa attack the lemurs, only to be scared off by the fearsome appearance of Alex, who selfishly blames Marty for the group's predicament and makes several attempts to get them back to civilization. Marty finds life in Madagascar to be exactly what he was looking for and Gloria and Melman soon join him. Alex, finally coming to realize how selfish and entitled he has been and after some encouragement from Marty, eventually comes around and makes amends, but without the raw steaks he was provided at the Central Park Zoo, his hunger sets in and his predatory instincts begin to show.  The next morning, the lemurs' leader, ring-tailed lemur King Julien XIII, leads his subjects into befriending the castaways in hopes that Alex's presence will keep the fossa at bay, despite protest about Alex's predatory nature from his adviser, Maurice, an aye-aye. After briefly losing his sanity and attacking Marty and his friends, Alex realizes what he has done and, fearing he may be a danger to his friends, flees to the fossa territory of the island. Seeing what Alex has become and how dangerous the wild can be, Marty regrets his decision to leave the zoo.  Having found Antarctica to be inhospitable, the penguins land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing the chance to return Alex to New York City, Marty crosses over to the fossa territory, following Alex's trail through the jungle Alex made earlier and attempts to convince Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear as he still feels ashamed for biting Marty. As Marty reminds Alex of their friendship and their home in New York, the fossa arrive and chase Marty away. Though Gloria, Melman, and the penguins come to the rescue, they are far outnumbered. Alex arrives at the last minute, having overcome his predatory instincts. He rescues his friends, and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory permanently.  The penguins satisfy Alex's hunger by feeding him sushi, which he finds better than steak. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the group, the penguins decide not to tell them that the ship has run out of fuel, leaving them stranded on the island for the time being.","Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath","Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer"

Po outsmarts Zhen and sends her to prison, but a group of mine workers tells him that Tai Lung has returned from the Spirit Realm and destroyed an entire quarry. Zhen reveals that Tai Lung's return was masqueraded by a sorceress known as The Chameleon, who can shape-shift into any animal she wants as well as copying various kung fu skills simply by touching them.  With Zhen's assistance, Po travels to Juniper City to take down The Chameleon, little knowing that his fathers, worried that he will not stand a chance against her, are following them. After visiting a shifty tavern and fighting off the inhabitants, Po and Zhen soon arrive at Juniper City and are almost arrested, but escape to the Den of Thieves, where they receive aid from Han, the den s pangolin leader, and Zhen s old mentor.

He witnesses the lemons, seemingly led by German weapons designer Professor Z ndapp, loading an electromagnetic pulse generator, disguised as a TV camera, onto a shipping crate. After discovering Turbo's death, Finn's presence gets exposed to the lemons, and he escapes by faking his death.  After winning his fourth Piston Cup, Lightning McQueen returns to Radiator Springs to spend his off-season with his friends. Italian formula race car Francesco Bernoulli challenges Lightning to participate in the World Grand Prix, an international three-race event created by former oil tycoon Sir Miles Axlerod, who intends to promote his new environmentally friendly fuel, Allinol. Lightning and his best friend Mater   along with Luigi, Guido, Fillmore, and Sarge   depart for Tokyo, where the first race takes place.  At a World Grand Prix promotional event, Mater makes a scene after eating wasabi (mistaking it for pistachio ice cream) and seemingly leaking on stage, embarrassing Lightning. While cleaning up, Mater interrupts a fight between American spy Rod ""Torque"" Redline (set to deliver some intel to Finn) and lemons Grem and Acer. Redline plants his tracking device on Mater, causing Finn and his associate Holley Shiftwell to mistake Mater for their contact. Meanwhile, Redline is captured and killed by Z ndapp, who reveals that Allinol ignites when hit with an EMP. He informs his superior, an unknown mastermind, that Redline passed on his information. Holley finds and recruits Mater to stop Z ndapp's plot, though he mistakes this as her asking him out on a date.  During the race, three racers are ignited by the camera. Lightning placed second in the race after Bernoulli, due to miscommunication with Mater, who was evading Z ndapp's henchmen. Lightning confronts him at the pits, snapping at him and declaring that he doesn't want his help. A guilt-ridden Mater prepares to board a plane back to Radiator Springs, but is abducted by Finn, and they escape from the lemons in his jet, Siddeley. After traveling to Paris to gather intel from Finn's old friend Tomber, they head to Porto Corsa, Italy, where the second race takes place. Meanwhile, on the day before the race, Luigi and Guido's uncle, Topolino, convinces a guilt-ridden Lightning to make amends with Mater. During the race, Mater infiltrates the lemons' meeting, just as the camera ignites some more racers, causing a multi-car pile-up, while Lightning wins. Due to controversy over Allinol's safety, Axlerod lifts its requirement for use in the final race in London. When Lightning decides to continue using it, the lemons plan to kill him in the race. This spooks Mater, and he accidentally blows his cover, causing him, Finn, and Holley to be captured and tied up inside Big Bentley, where he admits to them that he is not the spy they think he is.  When the race starts, Lightning takes the lead before passing Big Bentley, but the camera inexplicably does not ignite him. The lemons tell Mater that they planted a time bomb in Lightning's pits as a backup plan, spurring him to escape. Finn and Holley escape but realize that the bomb was fitted on Mater's air filter instead, having made his escape too easy to allay suspicion. As Mater is informed of this, he flees down the track, and Lightning pursues him to apologize for his outburst, while Finn apprehends Z ndapp. The other lemons arrive and outnumber Finn, Holley, Mater, and Lightning, but they are rescued by the other Radiator Springs residents and Sarge's colleagues in the British Army. Mater and Lightning go to Buckingham Palace, where Mater exposes Axlerod as the mastermind, proven when he is forced to disable the bomb. It is then revealed that the World Grand Prix was his cover-up to turn the world against alternative fuels, and use his ownership of the most untouched oil refineries in the world to gain profits. After Axlerod and the lemons are arrested by the London police, Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen, and he and Lightning reconcile.  Back in Radiator Springs, as Mater tells everyone about his experience, Lightning asks everyone why the camera didn't work on him.

The protagonist, although reluctant at first, climbs aboard, and finds a bunch of other children on board, including a spirited girl and a know-it-all boy. The train then stops to pick up a lonely boy, who also initially refuses to board, but changes his mind as the train moves away. Much to the Conductor's fury, the protagonist applies the emergency brake, and the lonely boy is allowed on board, but he decides to sit alone in the observation car.

Assuming that she will be thrown off the train, the protagonist finds the ticket and traverses the rooftops to find the girl. He encounters a mysterious ghostly hobo who helps him reach the engine. The protagonist discovers that the girl has been put in charge of the train while the engineer and fireman are replacing the engine's headlight.

During the subsequent clash, Puss suffers a panic attack and flees after the wolf reappears, allowing Goldi to take the map from Kitty.  After Perrito finds Puss and calms him down, Puss confesses his fears and remorse for abandoning Kitty before their wedding. She overhears Puss and tells him that she did not attend the wedding either, believing he loved himself too much to love her. Reinvigorated, Puss and Kitty retrieve the map while Goldi and the Bears are distracted by a manifestation of their woodland cottage. While escaping from Goldi and the Bears, Puss becomes trapped in a crystalline cave, where reflections of his past lives ridicule him for changing his outlook. The wolf arrives and reveals himself as Death, who is outraged by Puss' failure to value any of his lives and intends to take his final life personally. Horrified, Puss runs out of the cave towards the Star, leaving Kitty and Perrito behind.  During an argument with Baby Bear, Goldi reveals she intends to wish for a human family. Though this hurts the Bears' feelings, they still agree to help her. Puss arrives at the Star and begins to make his wish, but Kitty arrives, berates him for his selfishness, and reveals she would have wished for someone she could trust. Goldi, the Bears, and Horner arrive, and a fight ensues for the map. Goldi briefly obtains it but abandons it to save Baby Bear, while Kitty traps Horner inside his magical bottomless bag.  Death arrives and challenges Puss to a duel. Having learned the value of life from his time with his companions, Puss forgoes wishing for more lives and accepts, temporarily disarming Death. Puss declares that, while he can never truly defeat Death, he will never stop fighting for his last life. Realizing Puss is no longer arrogant, Death begrudgingly spares him and leaves, though he and Puss acknowledge that they will eventually meet again.  Horner escapes the bag by eating a magic snack that transforms him into a giant. Perrito distracts him, allowing Puss, Kitty, and Goldi to destroy the map, which causes the Wishing Star to consume Horner and explode. Goldi affirms to the Bears that they are her true family, and they decide to take over Horner's business. Puss rekindles his romance with Kitty; with Perrito in tow, they steal a ship and head to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to visit Shrek and some old friends.","Joel Crawford, Januel Mercado","Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Harvey Guill n"

For years, the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her.  One day, Snow White meets and falls in love with a prince who overhears her singing. That same day, the Magic Mirror deems Snow White as the fairest. The Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring back her heart in a jeweled box as proof. The Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White and warns her of the Queen's intentions. At his urging, Snow White flees deep into the forest.  Lost and frightened, Snow White is befriended by woodland animals, who lead her to a hidden woodland cottage. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children. With the animals' help, she proceeds to clean the place and cook a meal. Snow White soon learns that the cottage is the home of seven dwarfs named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. Snow White introduces herself, and the dwarfs welcome her after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night, they all sing, play music, and dance.  Back at the castle, the Magic Mirror reveals that Snow White is still living, and with the dwarfs. Enraged that the Huntsman gave her a pig's heart, the Queen uses a potion to disguise herself as an old peddler and then creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into Sleeping Death. She learns the curse can be broken by ""love's first kiss,"" but is certain Snow White will be buried alive before this can happen. The Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away. The animals see through the disguise but are unable to warn Snow White; they rush off to find the dwarfs. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the apple, and she falls into a death-like slumber.  The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder onto them, but lightning strikes the cliff before she can do so, causing her to fall to her death. In their cottage, the dwarfs find Snow White asleep from the poison. Unwilling to bury her, they instead place her in a glass coffin in the forest. Together with the animals, they keep watch over her.  The following spring, the prince learns of Snow White's eternal sleep and visits the coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, breaking the spell and awakening her. The dwarfs and animals rejoice as the prince takes Snow White to his castle.","William Cottrell, David Hand, Wilfred Jackson","Adriana Caselotti, Harry Stockwell, Lucille La Verne"

The pollution in the lake erodes the band's barge, causing them to drown. During their memorial, Grampa Simpson has a spiritual experience and prophesies that a disaster will befall Springfield, which only Marge takes seriously. Concerned about the terrible state of the environment, Lisa and her new boyfriend Colin hold a seminar and convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart engage in a dare contest, in which Homer dares Bart to skateboard to Krusty Burger and back naked. After Bart is caught by the police, Homer has Bart take the blame for the dare. At Krusty Burger, Homer adopts a pig to save it from being slaughtered by Krusty the Clown. When Homer brings the pig back home, Marge identifies the pig as a part of the prophecy and warns Homer to get rid of it, but he refuses and names him ""Plopper"". Homer's fawning over Plopper makes Bart, now fed up with Homer's carelessness, look to Ned Flanders as a father figure.  Marge orders Homer to dispose of an overflowing silo full of Plopper's feces (and some of Homer's own, as well). Rather than disposing of it safely, he becomes distracted after hearing that Lard Lad is giving away free donuts and hastily dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. After a squirrel falls into the lake and becomes mutated, Russ Cargill, head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), informs President Arnold Schwarzenegger of Springfield's pollution crisis and presents him with five solutions. Schwarzenegger randomly picks the third option   sealing Springfield off from the rest of the world under a giant glass dome.  Being trapped under the dome causes mass hysteria in Springfield and when Homer's silo is discovered on the news, hundreds of townspeople arrive at the Simpsons' house in an attempt to lynch the family.

The family is furious at Homer for his blundering, but he convinces them to follow him to Alaska, where he had always planned to go if something like the incident happened. Homer wins a truck by riding a motorcycle around a globe of death and the family restarts their lives in a remote Alaskan cabin.  As Springfield begins exhausting its supplies, the townspeople eventually attack the dome and the city descends into chaos. Cargill, mad with the power he has over Springfield and outraged by their defiance, tricks Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's demolition.

Realizing that their hometown is in danger, the family vow to save it sans Homer, who refuses to leave Alaska and storms out.

A distraught Homer is recovered by an Inuk shaman, who helps him come to an epiphany about his selfishness; he decides to save the town and his family. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids are captured by the EPA in Seattle and placed back inside the dome.  The EPA lowers a time bomb suspended by a rope through a hole at the top of the dome. While the townspeople attempt climbing the rope to escape, Homer returns to Springfield and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off, inadvertently shortening its countdown and further provoking the town's ire. Refusing to give up, Homer reconciles with Bart and they use a motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome with the bomb. Bart throws the bomb through the hole seconds before it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town.

73,Hotel Transylvania 2,2015,"Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family","Some time after the events of the first film, Mavis and Johnny are finally married, with the approval of her father Count Dracula. A year after the wedding, Mavis reveals to Drac that she is pregnant and later gives birth to a baby boy whom the couple name Dennis, nicknamed  Denisovich  by Dracula.  As Dennis's fifth birthday nears, he has yet to grow his fangs and Drac worries that his grandson might not gain vampire powers. Noticing the potential dangers her son might face living in Transylvania, Mavis starts to consider moving to Johnny's hometown in Santa Cruz, California in order to give Dennis a more  normal  childhood, much to Drac's disapproval. Drac tells Johnny, who does not want to leave the hotel either, to bring Mavis to California to visit his parents, Mike and Linda, but to make sure to keep her distracted so that she will not move, leaving Drac to ""babysit"" Dennis.  Convinced that Dennis is a ""late fanger"", Drac enlists his friends Frank, Wayne, Griffin, Murray, and Blobby to help train Dennis to become a monster, but every attempt that some of them try fails. Drac and the gang then go to Camp Winnepacaca, Drac's childhood summer camp, only to sneak away after Drac finds out that the camp has become much safer and child-friendly. Drac attempts to hurl Dennis from a tall, unstable tower to pressure the boy's transformation into a bat, but he fails to transform and Drac flies down and rescues him at the last second. Afterwards, Frank ends up loosening the tower and it collapses onto the campfire setting both the tower and a screaming Frank on fire as he runs through all the buildings, setting the entire camp on fire.  Meanwhile, in California, Mavis enjoys exploring the more human world. When the couple arrive at Mike and Linda's house, Linda unsuccessfully attempts to make Mavis feel more comfortable by covering her room with spooky, Halloween decorations and inviting other monster/human couples over. Feeling like a stranger, Mavis retreats up to the roof, and Johnny tells her that if they stay together, Dennis will live normally, persuading her to stay at the hotel. However, Johnny then discovers a video of Dennis falling that was filmed by the campers, and he and a furious Mavis go back to Transylvania, with Drac and his friends reaching the hotel at the same time. Mavis confronts her father for putting Dennis in grave danger and failing to letting humans into his heart, by showing him a pop remix video the campers made of Dennis's fall from the tower and Drac arguing with the staff. Mavis says that they will move out of the hotel after Dennis's birthday party.  The night before the party, Drac hosts Johnny's family, and finds out that Mavis invited his father Vlad. As Vlad is more hateful of humans than he was, Drac tells Johnny to have his family disguise themselves as monsters. The next day, Vlad arrives with his monstrous bat-like servant Bela, and meets Dennis for the first time. Believing that fear will cause Dennis' fangs to sprout, Vlad possesses a stage performer, named Brandon, dressed as Dennis' favorite TV monster Kakie to scare him, but Drac shields his frightened grandson at the last moment, breaking Vlad's hold over the performer. Mavis mistakenly believes that Drac was responsible for the ruse, and while the family argues about whether or not Dennis can be happy in California, a guilt-ridden Dennis flees the hotel and enters the forest with Wayne and Wanda's daughter Winnie, whom he has a mutual crush on, in tow.  Irritated with Vlad, Johnny and his family expose themselves, and an irate Vlad reprimands Drac for accepting humans before Drac rightfully tells off Vlad for not accepting Dennis as family just for being half human. Upon hearing that Dennis is a human, Bela attacks him and Winnie in their treehouse and abducts them. When Bela injures Winnie and threatens to destroy the hotel, Dennis's anger causes him to instantly grow his fangs and develop his vampire abilities, and he bashes up Bela. A furious Bela calls his giant-bat minions, but Drac, Johnny, Mavis, Dennis, and the rest of the monsters team up to defeat Bela's minions and drive them away, while Bela is shrunk by Vlad after making an attempt to kill Johnny. Vlad has been won over by Drac's claim that humans now coexist peacefully. With Dennis finally embracing his vampire abilities, Johnny and Mavis decide to continue raising him in Transylvania, and they resume the party with his friends and family.",Genndy Tartakovsky,"Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez"

However, Dracula's arch-nemesis Professor Abraham Van Helsing boards the train and unveils the monsters; the monsters escape by climbing through the roof, and Dracula pushes his friends off the train for their safety. Van Helsing becomes obsessed with destroying Dracula, but is constantly outsmarted by him.  In the present day, one year after the second film, Drac is running his hotel business smoothly with Mavis and Johnny. Drac is depressed that he has remained single since his wife Martha's death despite his attempts to meet someone. Misinterpreting this as stress from overwork, Mavis books a cruise so they can all take a break and spend more time together as a family. Drac, Johnny, Mavis, Dennis, Vlad, and the hotel guests board a cruise ship called Legacy. Drac sees the ship's human captain, Ericka, and falls in love with her at first sight, something that he thought was impossible as he had already ""zinged"" before.  Ericka afterwards goes to a private and secret room on the lower decks where she meets up with Abraham Van Helsing, secretly her great-grandfather. Van Helsing has almost entirely mechanized his body to avoid death, and has a plan to eliminate all the monsters: on the cruise's arrival at the lost city of Atlantis, he will use an Instrument of Destruction in Atlantis' ruins. Van Helsing makes Ericka promise to not assassinate Dracula beforehand, but she makes repeated unsuccessful attempts to do so anyway. Drac's friends hear Ericka complain about her inability to get him and misinterpret this as a sign of affection. Drac nervously asks Ericka out on a date, and she accepts since she sees this as another opportunity to kill him. As they dine on a deserted island, Ericka unexpectedly begins to fall in love with Drac, after they learn about each other's pasts where they lost their loved ones - for Drac, it was his beloved wife Martha and for Ericka, it was her parents.

Mavis arrives and confronts them, and Dracula confesses that he ""zinged"" with Ericka, to Mavis's surprise and confusion. After Ericka is told what a ""zing"" is, her inner guilt about lying to Drac forces her to reject his feelings for her, leaving Drac heartbroken and Mavis feeling guilty.  A regretful Ericka gives Van Helsing the Instrument of Destruction and he sets a trap for the monsters at a dance party. Noticing that Drac is still depressed about Ericka, Mavis takes advice from Johnny and tells her father to talk to Ericka, admitting that she was afraid of him leaving her, which allays Drac's fears. Van Helsing shows up and pushes away the DJ and a saddened Ericka is forced to reveal that she is his great-granddaughter. Van Helsing unveils the Instrument of Destruction a case for a music note sheet and plays a song that drives a friendly Kraken living near the island to attack the monsters. Drac tries to stop the evil Kraken, but gets injured. Ericka saves Drac from the evil Kraken and pleads with her great-grandfather to stop the destruction, confessing her love for Drac. This infuriates Van Helsing, and he attacks them both.  To pacify the evil Kraken, Johnny opens up a portable DJ kit and plays positive songs to beat Van Helsing's song. Upon playing the ""Macarena"", the Kraken is relaxed and happy for good. Van Helsing is unable to counter the song as the humans and monsters begins to dance, including the music sheet, which rips itself to pieces during the process.

75,Kung Fu Panda 2,2011,"Animatino, Action, Adventure, Family","Long ago, the peacock rulers of Gongmen City invented fireworks for peaceful purposes, but their son, Lord Shen, discovered that the black powder could also be weaponized. Troubled by Shen's obsession, his parents consulted a soothsayer, who foretold them that if he continued down this path, he would be defeated by ""a warrior of black and white"". Overhearing the prophecy, Shen deduced that the warrior would be a panda and, in an attempt to avoid his fate, led his wolf army to exterminate the pandas across China. Horrified by the genocide, Shen's parents banished him.  In the present, Shen and his army raid villages for scrap metal to build cannons that Shen will use to conquer China. Meanwhile, Po has become a kung fu master and regularly fights crime across the Valley of Peace alongside the Furious Five, although Master Shifu warns him that he has not yet achieved inner peace. When Shen's army raids another village, Po and the Five intercept them, but a symbol on the leader's armor resembling a red eye gives Po a memory of when he last saw his mother. Po consults his father, Mr. Ping, who reveals that he found Po as a cub in a shipment of radishes outside his restaurant and adopted him when no one came to claim him. Po and the Five are dispatched to Gongmen City after learning that Shen killed Master Thundering Rhino, a city regent, with one of the cannons. Shen imprisons the other regents, Masters Ox and Croc, and takes over the city, but the soothsayer constantly reminds him of the prophecy.  Upon arriving in Gongmen City, Po and the Five free Master Ox and Croc, who refuse to help. Po and the Five feign surrender to Shen, secretly replacing Mantis with an action figure while the real Mantis frees the others. They destroy the prototype cannon, but Po sees the same familiar symbol on Shen's plumage, distracting him long enough for Shen to escape and destroy Gongmen Palace with multiple cannons. After escaping, Tigress confronts Po, who reveals that he remembers seeing Shen when he last saw his biological parents. Tigress sympathizes but worries that Po's lack of focus will get him killed. The Five abandon him for his safety and proceed to destroy Shen's cannon factory.  Po follows the Five to the factory and confronts Shen, inadvertently ruining their plan and allowing the Five to be captured. Shen lies, claiming Po's parents never loved him, and shoots him afar with a cannon. Badly wounded but alive, Po floats downriver and is rescued by the soothsayer, who nurses him back to health in the village where he once lived as an infant and encourages him to embrace his past. Po, finally achieving inner peace, remembers his father fighting off the army while his mother hid him in the radish crate, drawing off Shen's army so he could survive. Rejuvenated, Po returns to Gongmen City, where Shen is sailing downriver with his army and a fleet of warships. Po frees the Five, and with the help of Masters Ox, Croc, and Shifu, they destroy the foremost ships and prevent the army from reaching the harbor. Shen fires the cannon on his flagship, killing most of his own soldiers to clear the way.  Everyone is injured by the blast except Po, who stands alone against Shen, using his newfound inner peace skills to deflect the cannonballs shot at him back at the fleet. After destroying all the ships and eliminating Shen's army, Po then uses the final cannonball to deflect it back at Shen's flagship, which explodes.  On the wreckage of the flagship, Po offers mercy to Shen, who rejects it and attacks Po with a spear. During the fight, Shen accidentally severs the lines holding up the destroyed cannon, which falls and crushes him. Shifu and the Five congratulate Po and return to the Valley of Peace; Po reaffirms his identity to Mr. Ping as his adoptive father.

Hopper, having become aware of what had happened, demands double the food ration for the next season.

Flea the circus bugs manage to defeat some flies, so Flik thinks they are the warrior bugs he was looking for, and the bugs believe him to be a talent scout and agree to go with him to the island.  Once on the island, the bugs are horrified to learn that they will actually have to fight the grasshopper gang to the death, and reveal to Flik that they are actually circus bugs and blame him for not telling them the truth, so they leave the island, but just as they are about to leave, a bird arrives with the intention of eating the bugs.

While the Fake Bird was being built, the grasshopper group was living happily in the desert with plenty of food for the winter, but Hopper, very seriously, tells them that the ants greatly outnumber them and then they worry that the ants will one day revolt against them, so they decide to return to keep them at bay. Finally, the circus ringmaster, P.T., arrives looking for the circus bugs as they were celebrating having built the bird. He tells his circus bugs that the act that went wrong ended up being a hit with the public and hires them back, at the same time revealing to the entire ant colony that they are actually circus bugs.

Private detective Eddie Valiant, once a staunch ally of the toons alongside his brother and co-worker Teddy, has become a depressed alcoholic following Teddy's murder by an unknown toon five years earlier. Maroon Cartoon Studios owner R.K. Maroon, upset about the recent poor performance of his toon star Roger Rabbit, hires Eddie to investigate rumors that Roger's glamorous toon wife, Jessica, is having an affair with Marvin Acme, owner of both the Acme Corporation and Toontown, the animated metropolis in which toons reside.  After watching Jessica perform at The Ink and Paint Club, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty-cake. He shows the pictures to Roger, who becomes distraught and flees, refusing to believe Jessica was unfaithful. The next morning, Acme is found murdered and evidence at the scene implicates Roger as a suspect. Eddie meets Judge Doom, the sinister human judge of Toontown having bribed the electorate to gain their votes and his five weasel minions, the Toon Patrol. Doom confirms he plans to execute Roger using the ""Dip"", a chemical concoction of acetone, benzene, and turpentine which is capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons.  Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, suggests to Eddie that Acme's missing will which supposedly bequeaths Toontown to the toons may have been the killer's true motive. Eddie returns to his office and finds Roger waiting. Roger insists he has been framed and Eddie reluctantly agrees to help after finding evidence of Acme's will; he hides Roger in a bar tended by his girlfriend, Dolores. Jessica tells Eddie that Maroon threatened Roger's career unless she posed for the compromising photos. Meanwhile, Dolores's research uncovers that Cloverleaf Industries recently bought the city's Pacific Electric railway system and will purchase Toontown at midnight unless Acme's will is found.

Maroon is assassinated and Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene. Assuming she is the assailant, he reluctantly follows her into Toontown, choosing to discard the last of his alcohol. After saving Eddie from being shot by Doom, Jessica reveals her actions were to ensure Roger's safety and it was Doom who killed Acme and Maroon. Acme gave his will to Jessica for safety but, when she examined it, the paper was blank.  Doom and the Toon Patrol capture Jessica and Eddie, bringing them to Acme's factory. Doom reveals he is the sole shareholder of Cloverleaf and plans to erase Toontown with a Dip-spraying machine so he can build a freeway in its place, and decommission the railway system to force people to use it. When Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine's sprayer. Eddie distracts the weasels by performing a comedic vaudeville act full of pratfalls, causing them to die of laughter before he kicks their leader into the Dip. Doom is flattened by a steamroller while fighting with Eddie, but he survives, revealing he is actually a disguised toon and Teddy's murderer. Struggling against Doom's toon abilities, Eddie empties the machine's Dip supply, spraying and dissolving Doom to death. The machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a passenger train.  As police and toons gather at the scene, Eddie realizes that Acme's will was written on the blank paper in temporarily invisible ink, confirming the toons inherit Toontown.

85,Horton Hears a Who!,2008,"Family, Comedy, Animation, Adventue","In the Jungle of Nool, Horton the Elephant, the jungle's eccentric nature teacher, hears a tiny yelp coming from a floating dust speck and gives chase to it before placing it on top of a flower. Horton finds out the speck harbors the city of Whoville and its inhabitants, the Whos, led by Mayor Ned McDodd, whose family includes his wife, Sally; 96 daughters whose names all begin with the letter H; and one teenage son named JoJo. Despite being the oldest child and next in line for the mayoral position, JoJo does not want to be the next mayor, and he does not speak due to his fear of disappointing his father.  Once Horton begins carrying the speck with him, the city starts experiencing strange phenomena (earthquakes and changes in the weather), and the mayor finds his attempts to caution Whoville challenged by the town council, led by the opportunistic yet condescending chairman.  After he makes contact with Horton, the mayor finds out from Dr. Mary Lou LaRue that Whoville will be destroyed if Horton does not find a safe location for the speck to reside. With the help of his best friend Morton the mouse, Horton decides to place the speck atop Mt. Nool, the safest place in the jungle. The head of the jungle, the Sour Kangaroo, who despises Horton for his lackadaisical influence on the children and subsequently ""pouch-schooling"" her son Rudy, demands numerous times that Horton give up the speck for overshadowing her authority, but Horton refuses. Also taking force toward Horton are the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys and lackeys to the Kangaroo who like to cause havoc around the jungle. Eventually, the Kangaroo, refusing to believe that the Whos exist, enlists a sinister but idiotic vulture named Vlad Vladikoff to get rid of the speck by force.  After a few failed attempts, Vlad manages to steal the flower away from Horton and drops it into a massive field of identical pink flowers causing an apocalyptic tremor in Whoville. After unsuccessfully picking flowers all day, Horton eventually recovers the flower (exactly the 3,000,000th flower), also revealing himself to the rest of Whoville, who have largely survived. The Kangaroo eventually finds out that Horton still has the speck, fires Vlad, and rallies the Wickersham Brothers and the other animals of Nool into capturing Horton, preying on their fears that their own children will become chaotic delinquents under his influence.  Upon an angry mob, stampeding to Horton and cornering him, the Kangaroo offers Horton a final chance to renounce Whoville's existence. Horton refuses, and despite the heartfelt speech that he gives, the Kangaroo orders the animals to rope and cage him, and to have the speck and Whoville destroyed in a pot of boiling beezlenut oil. The Mayor enlists all of his people to make noise, so that all the animals will find out they're really there, assisted by JoJo's ""Symphonophone"", an invention which creates a huge musical contribution and reveals that JoJo's true passion is music, but still fails to penetrate the surface of the speck.  The Kangaroo snatches the flower from the captured Horton and prepares to drop it into the pot. Meanwhile, JoJo grabs the horn used to project Horton's voice, runs up the highest tower, and screams his first word ""Yopp!"", breaking through the sound barrier just seconds before the speck hits the oil, and causing Rudy to grab the flower just in time before it reaches to the oil. Upon the animals hearing the Whos, they release Horton and shun the Kangaroo for tricking them while Rudy ignores her demands to return to her pouch and gives the speck back to Horton.  Despite this, Horton forgives the ostracized Kangaroo with a cookie from Vlad the bunny, who in turn provides a makeshift umbrella for Whoville as Horton and the animals of Nool carries them to Mt. Nool while saying farewell to each other by singing ""Can't Fight This Feeling"", and it is revealed that the Jungle of Nool (and Earth as a whole) is just one speck, like Whoville, among numerous others floating in space.","Jimmy Hayward, Steve Martino","Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Carol Burnett"

A heartbroken Poppy then turns gray in her misery, believing the situation is all her fault; the rest of the Trolls also become sad and lose their colors.  Branch breaks his rule and sings to cheer Poppy up; this successfully brings back both their colors and those of the other trolls. Bridget, grateful to the Trolls for helping her, secretly releases them from the pot while Chef is not looking. Poppy refuses to let Bridget be punished for their escape, so the Trolls return to Bergen Town, reveal to the Bergens that Bridget is Lady Glittersparkles, and explain that she and Gristle are happily in love with each other. This shows the rest of the Bergens that they can find happiness within themselves without eating the Trolls, and the Trolls and the Bergens celebrate together in song, ending their feud. Chef refuses to accept the peace, so she and Creek are sent rolling out of Bergen Town on a flaming serving cart. King Peppy crowns Poppy the Queen of the Trolls, and she and Branch share a hug.

Unable to get Johnny out of the hotel without notice, Drac quickly improvises that Johnny is a party planner, brought in to bring a fresher approach to his own traditional and boring parties. Johnny quickly becomes a hit to the other monsters, but this worries Drac, who is both envious of Johnny's popularity and afraid that his friends will never return to the hotel if they find out the truth about him. Drac coerces Johnny to leave, but he is brought back by Mavis, who is unaware of Johnny's real species and feud with her father. After being shown the beauty of a sunrise by Johnny, Mavis is inspired to give humans another chance. Meanwhile, the hotel chef Quasimodo, with the help of his pet rat Esmeralda, learns that Johnny is a human and kidnaps him to cook him. Drac intervenes and magically freezes Quasimodo to keep him from telling anyone that Johnny is human. Drac leads Johnny to his quarters and shows him a painting of Martha, allowing Johnny to realize why Drac built the hotel, became overprotective of Mavis, and his hatred for humans. Johnny then agrees to leave for good, but Drac, noticing that Mavis and Johnny's feelings for each other are real, persuades him to stay for the time being to avoid ruining Mavis's birthday. Drac and Johnny begin to bond and have fun together. The party is a great success the next night, and Mavis looks forward to opening a gift from Martha. However, when Johnny and Mavis share their first kiss, Drac overreacts, and in his outburst, inadvertently confesses to deceiving Mavis with the town. A still-frozen Quasimodo bursts in and Mr. Fly reveals from his frozen speech that Johnny is a human disguised by Drac. The guests are shocked and outraged by the deceit at play, but Mavis is undeterred and wants to be with Johnny. Johnny rejects her out of respect for her father and leaves the hotel. A heartbroken Mavis flies onto the roof with her mother's gift, and Drac follows in hopes of comforting her. He learns the present is a book about how he and Martha ""Zinged"" and fell in love, and realizes he no longer knows mankind s true tolerance of monsters. After apologizing to the patrons, Drac persuades Frank, Wayne, Griffin, and Murray to head out into the human world to help him find Johnny, and with the scent-tracking ability of Wayne's daughter, Winnie, they learn that he is about to catch a flight back to the United States. The five head to the airport, but are held up in a town celebrating a Monster Festival along the way. Frankenstein attempts to scare away the assembled crowd of humans with a loud roar but instead receives wild applause and adoration. He then gets the humans to agree to help, and a team of men dressed as vampires provides Drac shelter from the sunlight while he rushes to the airport. Drac arrives to see Johnny's plane taking off, and he gives chase in bat form, burning in the sunlight. After getting Johnny's attention, Drac makes his way to the windshield of the plane and uses his mind-controlling power on the pilot to help him apologize over the plane's PA system, stating that Mavis has grown up and can make her own decisions. Johnny accepts his apology, and Drac manipulates the pilot to return to the Transylvanian airport. Drac returns Johnny to Mavis, announcing that he approves of Johnny. Johnny confesses to Mavis that their ""Zing"" was mutual and the two kiss. The monsters finish celebrating Mavis's party, impressing the hotel guests.",Genndy Tartakovsky,"Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Andy Samberg"

Though both land in Metro City simultaneously, Metro Man is raised in a mansion and Megamind in a prison. At the school they attend, Metro Man is well-liked by his classmates, while Megamind is relentlessly bullied until he reaches his breaking point, setting off a rivalry between him and Metro Man. As an adult, Megamind, aided by his fish-like companion Minion, frequently and unsuccessfully battles Metro Man for control of the city. On the day of the new Metro Man Museum s grand opening, Megamind escapes prison, kidnaps news reporter Roxanne Ritchi, and lures Metro Man to an abandoned observatory to rescue her. Once there, Metro Man collapses, stating the copper-lined observatory roof weakens his powers, before Megamind blasts him with a sun-powered death ray. Overjoyed, Megamind takes over the city and executes a crime spree, but eventually becomes depressed and purposeless without Metro Man to oppose him. Megamind decides to blow up the Metro Man Museum to forget the hero, but sees Roxanne is also there; as he runs, he dehydrates the museum's curator, Bernard, turning him into a small cube. Disguised as Bernard using hologram technology, Megamind talks to Roxanne, whose remarks inspire him to use Metro Man's DNA to create a new superhero to fight. Megamind perfects the formula, but during a fight between him and Roxanne in his lair, he accidentally injects it into Hal Stewart, Roxanne's cameraman who is infatuated with her. Disguising himself via hologram as Hal's ""Space Dad"", Megamind trains Hal to become a superhero. Hal, seeing this as a chance to win Roxanne's heart, accepts and takes on the name ""Titan"", which he misspells as ""Tighten"". Megamind begins to date Roxanne while disguised as Bernard, and he and Minion have a falling out over Megamind's apparent lack of interest in committing further crimes. Roxanne rejects Tighten when he comes to court her, and Tighten later witnesses her on a date with Megamind disguised as Bernard. After a heartbroken Tighten leaves, Megamind s disguise fails, and Roxanne rejects him as well. Megamind arranges to fight Tighten the next day, but soon learns that Tighten is now using his powers to conduct a crime spree. Tighten offers to ally with Megamind, who deliberately reveals his disguises and deceptions to goad Tighten into fighting. Angered, Tighten savagely beats Megamind in the fight. Realizing that Tighten is uninterested in justice and means to kill him, Megamind traps Tighten in a copper ball, but it fails when Tighten easily breaks out. Megamind and Roxanne escape to Metro Man's old hideout and discover that he is still alive, having faked his weakness and death to rename himself ""Music Man"", and pursue his dream as a musician. Megamind attempts to enlist his help against Tighten, but Metro Man refuses; he instead attempts to encourage Megamind to become the city's new hero by telling him that a hero will always rise to defeat evil. Dejected, Megamind willingly returns to prison. Tighten goes on a rampage and kidnaps Roxanne when she tries to reason with him. On a televised message, Tighten holds Roxanne hostage and demands that Megamind fight him. With Minion's help, Megamind escapes prison and reconciles with him. He goes to confront Tighten, using holographic disguises to appear as Metro Man, and Minion as Megamind, to frighten Tighten away and rescue Roxanne. However, Megamind's speech patterns give him away, and Tighten attacks Megamind, throwing him into the stratosphere. Dehydrating himself into a cube and landing safely in a fountain, Megamind re-hydrates next to Tighten and extracts the DNA from him, removing Tighten's powers. After Hal is arrested, Megamind and Roxanne rekindle their relationship, while the city celebrates Megamind as their new hero. The museum is rebuilt in Megamind's honor, a disguised Metro Man cheers for him at the grand opening ceremony, and everyone dances to Michael Jackson's ""Bad"".",Tom McGrath,"Will Ferell, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt"

John departs to explore the wilderness and encounters Pocahontas. At first, she speaks to him in Powhatan, but soon, he gains her trust. They quickly bond, fascinated by each other's worlds, and end up falling in love. After a fight between settlers and natives, Powhatan orders the natives to stay away from the Englishmen. Pocahontas, however, disobeys him and keeps meeting with John. Unfortunately, Pocahontas's best friend, Nakoma, discovers the secret relationship and warns Kocoum. Ratcliffe also learns of John's encounters and angrily warns him against sparing any Natives.Later, John and Pocahontas meet with Grandmother Willow and plan to bring peace between the colonists and the tribe. While both parties spy on the couple, John and Pocahontas share a kiss. Furious, Kocoum attacks and attempts to kill John, but Thomas, who had been ordered by Ratcliffe to follow John, intervenes and kills Kocoum. John orders Thomas to leave before the tribesmen arrive. They capture John and retrieve Kocoum's body. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan angrily scolds Pocahontas for leaving the village, and declares war on the English, beginning with John's execution at dawn.Reaching Jamestown, Thomas warns the settlers of John's capture. Ratcliffe then rallies his men to battle, using this as an excuse to annihilate the tribe and find their nonexistent gold. That same night, Powhatan also orders his men to prepare for battle. A desperate Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow and realizes the arrow from John's compass is the same spinning arrow from her dream, which leads to her destiny. Morning comes, and Powhatan and his tribe drag John to a cliff for his execution. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe leads the armed colonists to fight Powhatan's warriors. Just as Powhatan is about to execute John and start the war, Pocahontas intervenes and finally convinces him to end the fighting between the two groups and spare John's life. Both sides stand down, and John is released. Unmoved, Ratcliffe fires his musket at Powhatan, but John takes the shot to save him. Livid, and despite Ratcliffe accusing John of taking the shot, the settlers turn on him and arrest him for hurting their comrade.John is nursed back to health by the tribe but must return to England for his wounds to fully heal. Ratcliffe is also sent back to face punishment for his crimes against the settlement. John asks Pocahontas to come with him, but she chooses to stay with her tribe to help keep the peace.
